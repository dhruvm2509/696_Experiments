Ending 1: The Accidental Diplomats
Toryl and Sartan burst out of the swinging doors of Okie's Oasis, the shouts of the sheriff and the disgruntled patrons echoing behind them. Their blue-metallic suits, designed for the vacuum of space, felt heavy and cumbersome under the unfamiliar pull of Earth's gravity and the intense desert heat.   

"Brother, their velocity is quite surprising for such rudimentary biological forms!" Sartan transmitted, glancing back at the closing figures.

"Indeed! And their hostility remains perplexing," Toryl sent back, dodging a tumbleweed. "Could the malfunction of the money-consuming device truly warrant such aggression?"    

They sprinted across the dusty street, their advanced physiology giving them an edge in speed, though their unfamiliarity with the terrain made them clumsy. Behind them, the sheriff, Okie, Nugget McDermott, and a few others piled out of the bar, slowed by surprise and, in Okie's case, considerable girth.   

Just as the Capellans reached the edge of the small settlement, angling towards the shimmering outline of their hidden spacecraft, a piercing siren split the air. A vehicle, red and white with flashing lights atop, skidded to a halt, blocking their path. A man in a different uniform, crisper than the sheriff's, emerged, hand resting on a sidearm.

"Hold it right there!" the newcomer commanded.

The pursuing townsfolk caught up, panting. "Sheriff Miller, these fellas caused a ruckus back at Okie's! Busted a machine!" the local sheriff explained.   

The newcomer, identified by his badge as State Trooper Evans, held up a hand. "Alright, Sheriff, let's figure this out calmly." He eyed Toryl and Sartan, his gaze lingering on their suits and the strange devices visible in their pockets. "You boys... you're not from around here, are ya?"   

Toryl stepped forward, activating the crypterpreter resting against his chest. "That is cor-rect, Officer. We are vis-i-tors. From Capella".   

Trooper Evans blinked. "Capella... Like the star?" Unlike the locals, Evans had a passing interest in astronomy.

"Pre-cise-ly," Sartan confirmed. "We in-tend-ed no dis-re-spect or dam-age. We were mere-ly... cur-i-ous... about your devices". He indicated the electro-analyzer still faintly humming in Toryl's grasp.   

Okie pushed forward. "Curious? They broke my best bandit! It was spewing quarters like a broken fountain!"    

Evans looked from the fuming bar owner to the earnest-looking aliens. He'd dealt with strange things on desert highways, but this was unique. He keyed his radio, speaking in low tones.

Meanwhile, Toryl, sensing a slight shift in the atmosphere, decided on a different approach. He reached into a pouch and withdrew another pentagonal gold piece, like the one Okie had tested. He offered it to Okie. "For the dam-age to your... mon-ey con-sum-ing de-i-ty?"    

Okie stared at the gold, then at the aliens, his anger momentarily overshadowed by avarice and confusion. "Deity? It ain't no deity, it's a slot machine!"   

Evans finished his radio call. "Alright," he announced. "Seems Washington is very interested in talking to visitors from Capella. Especially ones carrying solid gold currency." He turned to the aliens. "Gentlemen, you're not under arrest, exactly. But you will need to come with me. We have a lot to discuss."

Toryl and Sartan exchanged glances. "Perhaps this is the proper chan-nel for establishing contact, Brother," Sartan transmitted.

"Agreed. Their initial representatives were... less than ideal."

They allowed Trooper Evans to escort them to his vehicle, leaving behind a bewildered sheriff, a calculating Okie clutching the gold piece, and a crowd still buzzing about Eskimos, light years, and broken slot machines. Their first, chaotic contact had ended not in jail, but with an unexpected, official welcome. Their mission to understand Earth had just taken a very strange, and potentially productive, turn.   

Ending 2: The Escape and the Observation Post
Panic fueled their flight. Toryl and Sartan scrambled away from the shouts and the rapidly assembling posse emerging from Okie's Oasis. Dust kicked up by their boots mingled with the shimmering heat waves rising from the desert floor.   

"Our ves-sel is point-seven kilo-cycles distant!" Toryl transmitted, his internal chronometer precise even under duress. "Can we reach it before they intercept?"

"Their ground trans-port appears limited and slow," Sartan observed, glancing back at the figures now milling uncertainly in the street. "However, their projectile weapons, if they possess them, are an unknown variable."

They didn't follow the road but cut across the arid landscape, weaving between sparse creosote bushes and jagged rocks. The metallic sheen of their suits, so out of place moments before, now seemed to shimmer and almost blend with the harsh sunlight, offering a bizarre form of camouflage.   

The sheriff and Okie attempted a brief pursuit on foot but quickly gave up in the oppressive heat, resorting to shouting threats that dissipated in the vast emptiness. Nugget McDermott, surprisingly spry, kept pace for a little longer before stopping to catch his breath, shaking his fist.   

Reaching a low ridge, the Capellans dropped behind it, momentarily out of sight. They activated their ship's remote recall beacon. Farther out in the desert, hidden by a sophisticated cloaking field, their scout craft shimmered into view, sand cascading off its hull as it silently lifted off the ground and glided towards their position.

"Analysis of the 'one-armed bandit' incident suggests a fundamental mis-un-der-stand-ing of prop-er-ty and en-ter-tain-ment concepts on this planet," Sartan transmitted as they waited. "The machine was designed for loss, yet its enforced payout generated extreme hostility".   

"Pre-cise-ly. And their belief sys-tems appear... volatile. They readily accepted the 'Alaska' hypothesis but dismissed interstellar origin despite our advanced tech-nol-o-gy". Toryl retrieved the electro-analyzer, which had automatically detached itself from the slot machine before their hasty exit. "The data retrieved from the device is incomplete due to the... energetic reaction. But it confirms complex internal mechanisms designed purely for statistical manipulation."   

The ship settled silently beside them, its portal hissing open. They scrambled aboard, the cool, sterile air of the cockpit a stark contrast to the planet's environment. As the ship ascended rapidly, Toryl activated the external optical sensors, zooming in on Okie's Oasis.

The townsfolk were gathered outside, pointing and gesturing. Okie was directing some men to gather the scattered quarters. The sheriff was talking animatedly into a handheld communicator.   

"Initial contact protocol requires re-e-val-u-a-tion," Sartan stated, reviewing the mission parameters on a console. "Direct interaction with the general populace appears counter-pro-duc-tive at this stage. Their societal norms are chaotic and their grasp of scientific principles seems limited."

"Agreed," Toryl replied, adjusting the ship's orbit to a geosynchronous position high above the desert town. "Recommendation: Establish a remote observation post. Monitor their communications, analyze their cultural broadcasts, and attempt contact only through carefully selected scientific or governmental channels, avoiding... 'Oasises'."    

"A prudent course, Brother. This planet, 'Earth,' presents far more complexities than anticipated. Their aggressive reaction to unexpected profit is particularly noteworthy for socio-economic modeling."

Below, life in Okie's Oasis slowly returned to its version of normal, forever colored by the bizarre tale of the gold-paying, machine-busting spacemen from "Alaska". High above, Toryl and Sartan began the long, patient process of understanding a world that defied their logical Capellan expectations, their first chaotic encounter serving as a stark lesson in the unpredictable nature of humanity.   

Ending 3: Stranded and Improvising
They ran, adrenaline overriding the disorientation caused by Earth's atmosphere and gravity. The angry shouts faded behind them as they put distance between themselves and Okie's Oasis.   

"The ship, Brother! We must reach the ship!" Sartan urged telepathically.

"Activating the recall beacon now!" Toryl concentrated, sending the mental command.

Nothing happened.

He tried again. Still nothing. A cold dread, an unfamiliar emotion learned from observing the humans, crept into his consciousness. "Sartan... the beacon is non-responsive. The electro-analyzer's discharge... it must have created an energy surge that fried the ship's primary receiver!"    

Sartan stopped, his blue face paling slightly. "Fried? You mean... we are stranded?"

"Temporarily. The secondary systems are shielded, but initiating remote start-up requires proximity. We must physically reach the landing site."

Their landing site was over twenty kilo-cycles away, across treacherous, unfamiliar desert terrain. And worse, glancing back, they saw not just the fading figures of the townsfolk, but the distinct shape of an old, battered truck kicking up a plume of dust, heading in their general direction along a barely visible track. It seemed the sheriff wasn't giving up so easily.   

"Our suits' energy reserves are limited," Sartan noted gravely. "Sustained atmospheric exposure wasn't calculated for this duration. And we have exhausted our supply of...'gold'".   

"Necessity dictates improvisation, Brother. Observe." Toryl pointed towards a cluster of junk metal and discarded machinery near an abandoned shack off the track. "These inhabitants discard functional materials readily. Perhaps we can utilize some."

They detoured towards the junk pile as the truck rumbled closer. Working quickly, their advanced knowledge of physics and engineering allowed them to see potential where humans saw scrap. Toryl used a focused energy beam from a multi-tool to cut and reshape pieces of metal. Sartan, recalling the simple mechanics of the 'one-armed bandit', cannibalized parts from a rusted engine block.   

The truck skidded to a halt nearby. The sheriff and a wary-looking deputy climbed out, shotguns leveled. "Alright, you tin-foil freaks! End of the line!" the sheriff yelled.   

"We seek no con-flict," Toryl stated, holding up his hands while subtly activating the device they had jury-rigged. "We merely re-quire trans-port."

The sheriff scoffed. "Transport? You're getting transport alright - straight to county lockup!"

Suddenly, the pile of junk behind the Capellans began to vibrate violently. With a loud clang and a shower of sparks, a crude magnetic pulse erupted outwards. It wasn't powerful enough to harm the humans, but it instantly overloaded the truck's primitive electrical system. The engine died with a cough, headlights flickered out, and the sheriff's radio crackled into silence.

The sheriff and deputy stared, dumbfounded, at their dead vehicle.

"A temporary measure, but effective," Sartan transmitted.

"Indeed. Let us proceed."

Leaving the two bewildered lawmen stranded with their useless truck, Toryl and Sartan set off at a steady, ground-eating pace towards their distant ship. Their first contact had gone disastrously wrong, leaving them temporarily marooned. But they were Capellans – adaptable, intelligent, and now acutely aware that survival on this strange, illogical planet would require more than just advanced technology; it would demand cunning and a willingness to get their metallic hands dirty. Their journey across the desert had just begun.

Ending 4: An Unlikely Alliance
The desert sun beat down as Toryl and Sartan fled Okie's Oasis. Their blue suits offered little respite from the heat. Behind them, the pursuit was disorganized but determined.   

"Their persistence is illogical," Sartan transmitted, navigating a patch of loose gravel. "The financial gain from the machine malfunction surely outweighs the damage".   

"Their motivations transcend simple economics, Brother. Pride, fear of the unknown, perhaps even the perceived violation of their 'gambling' ritual".   

They ducked behind a cluster of large boulders just as the sheriff's voice echoed, closer than they liked. Peeking out, they saw the posse spreading out, attempting to surround their position. Suddenly, a wiry figure detached itself from the main group and scrambled towards their hiding place with surprising speed. It was Nugget McDermott, the old prospector.   

The Capellans tensed, preparing for confrontation. But Nugget skidded to a halt before them, holding up his hands, palms empty. His bearded face was split by a conspiratorial grin.   

"Hold on there, fellas!" he whispered urgently. "Don't go gettin' spooked! Old Nugget ain't like them others."

Toryl tilted his head. "You do not wish to ap-pre-hend us?" he asked, keeping the crypterpreter low.   

"Apprehend?" Nugget chuckled, spitting tobacco juice onto the sand. "Heck no! I seen what you did back there! That gadget o' yours..." he eyed the electro-analyzer Toryl still held, "...made that ol' stingy machine cough up like it never has before!"  He leaned closer. "And I seen that 'money' you gave Okie. Pure gold, wasn't it?"    

Sartan confirmed, "It is a standard Capellan exchange medium."

Nugget's eyes gleamed. "Capellan, eh? Knew you weren't from Alaska! Listen, them folks back there," he jerked a thumb towards the searchers, "they're riled up 'cause you messed with Okie's business and spooked 'em. But Nugget... Nugget sees opportunity!"   

He lowered his voice further. "I know this desert like the back o' my hand. Been prospectin' here fifty years. I can get you clear o' the sheriff, easy. And... maybe... you fellas might be interested in a little partnership?"

Toryl and Sartan exchanged rapid mental communications. "His motivations are clear-ly self-serv-ing."

"Yet, he offers assistance we current-ly re-quire. And his knowledge of the local en-vir-on-ment could be invaluable."

"A calculated risk, then?"

"Agreed."

Toryl addressed the prospector. "What manner of 'part-ner-ship' do you pro-pose?"

Nugget grinned wider. "Simple! You help old Nugget with your fancy space gadgets... maybe help locate some o' that shiny stuff," he winked, "and I'll help you navigate this dusty rock, keep you outta trouble, maybe even help you understand folks like Okie. Deal?"

The sounds of the search party grew closer. Toryl looked at Sartan, who gave a slight nod. They needed a guide, and this human, despite his obvious avarice, seemed less hostile and potentially more useful than the others.

"We... ac-cept your pro-po-sal, Nugget McDermott," Toryl said.

"Hot dog!" Nugget exclaimed quietly. "Follow me, gents! And try to keep them shiny suits outta sight!"

Guided by the grizzled prospector, the two aliens slipped away from the closing net, melting into the shimmering heat haze of the Nevada desert. Their mission had taken an unexpected detour, forging an unlikely alliance born of mutual desperation and opportunity. Instead of fleeing Earth, they were now delving deeper into its wild frontier, guided by a prospector hoping to strike gold with the help of partners from forty-two million light years away.   

Ending 5: The Message Left Behind
Flight was undignified but necessary. Toryl and Sartan raced from Okie's Oasis, the confused and angry shouts of the humans fading slightly as they gained distance.   

"A most unsatisfactory initial contact," Sartan transmitted grimly. "Our scientific curiosity was interpreted as malicious destruction and theft".   

"Indeed. Their societal framework appears predicated on assumptions and immediate, often aggressive, reactions," Toryl agreed. "Perhaps direct interaction was premature. We lack sufficient cultural context."

They reached the concealed location of their scout ship without incident; the pursuit had faltered quickly in the face of the aliens' speed and the desert heat. The ship's ramp lowered silently.

As Sartan moved to board, Toryl paused, looking back towards the small town shimmering in the distance. He tapped the console on his wrist, activating a micro-fabrication unit.

"Brother? The optimal course is departure and remote analysis," Sartan prompted.

"One moment, Sartan. We caused disruption, however unintentional. Leaving without any attempt at clarification feels... incomplete. It violates exploration protocol Omega-7: 'Minimize Unresolved Cultural Perturbation'."

"Protocol Omega-7 also advises avoiding further contact if initial interaction proves hazardous, which this undeniably has," Sartan countered.

"Not direct contact. A message. Something they can discover later, something that might... recalibrate their perception."

Toryl directed the micro-fabricator. A small, intricate object began to form in the manipulator field – a perfect, multifaceted crystalline structure. Embedded within it, using focused light pulses, Toryl encoded a simplified visual message: schematic diagrams of Capella's location relative to known constellations, basic representations of their peaceful scientific intent, a simplified apology for the machine incident, and, crucially, the atomic structure of gold, alongside the structures of several other elements abundant on Capella but rare on Earth, hinting at the true nature of their 'currency'. It was a peace offering and a primer, all in one.   

He took the finished crystal – cool, smooth, and radiating a faint internal light. "We will leave this where they are likely to find it but unlikely to immediately connect it to us. Perhaps near where Nugget McDermott first identified our gold".   

Sartan considered this. "The probability of them deciphering the encoded message is low, given their demonstrated technological level."

"Perhaps. But the object itself is undeniably non-terrestrial. It introduces an anomaly, a mystery that might prompt further investigation rather than simple dismissal as 'tinhorns' or 'crackpots'".   

Silently, Toryl retraced his steps partway back towards the town under the cover of the ship's cloaking field, placing the crystal carefully near a distinctive rock formation where the prospector might search. He then rejoined Sartan on the ship.

The ramp closed, and the Capellan scout craft lifted silently into the deep blue sky, leaving the Nevada desert behind. Back at Okie's Oasis, the commotion died down. Okie counted his unexpected jackpot quarters, the sheriff filed a confusing report about spacemen from Alaska, and life resumed its slow pace.   

Days later, Nugget McDermott, prospecting near the edge of town, spotted an unusual glint. He picked up the crystal, turning it over and over, mesmerized by its strange beauty and internal light. He didn't understand the diagrams, but he knew, with the certainty of a man drawn to the unique, that this was no earthly rock. It was something... else. The aliens were gone, but they had left behind a question, a silent invitation to look beyond the immediate and consider the vastness from which they came. The true first contact hadn't ended with the chase; it had just begun with a mystery left nestled in the dust
