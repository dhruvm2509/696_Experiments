Ending 1: The Transcendent Vision

The blue cloud of incense smoke ascended towards Félicité's room, carrying with it the chants and the shuffling feet of the procession below. It mingled with the scent of damp plaster and the faint, musty odour emanating from Loulou, perched on the makeshift altar near her bed. Félicité’s breathing, shallow and ragged for days, now seemed almost to cease. Her blind eyes  were open, fixed on some point beyond the decaying ceiling. Mother Simon, having placed the dilapidated parrot, had returned to her meager breakfast, leaving the dying woman alone with her visions.   

In the dimness, the parrot on the altar pulsed with an inner light. It wasn't the gilded nut  or the sun catching its glass eye  this time; it was a soft, emerald and gold luminescence that seemed to emanate from within the tattered feathers and escaping wadding. The form swelled, no longer the pathetic, worm-eaten creature Mother Simon had handled, but vast, encompassing the small room. Its green body shimmered like the meadows near Geffosses in spring, its blue head held the depth of the summer sky over Trouville, the pink tips of its wings echoed the blush on Virginia’s cheeks before her illness, and its golden breast shone like the consecrated Host.   

This was not merely Loulou, nor just the image of the Holy Ghost from the Espinal print. It was a confluence, a divine synthesis of all she had loved and lost. Within the parrot’s expanding form, she saw fleeting images: Théodore, young and smiling as he first asked her to dance, not as the man who abandoned her; Victor, not lost to yellow fever in far-off Havana, but waving cheerfully from the deck of his ship, bringing her ginger-bread dolls; little Virginia, not pale and wasting away, but running through fields, her laughter echoing; even Madame Aubain, her stern face softened, offering that rare, equalising embrace. They weren't ghosts or memories summoned by a failing mind; they were presences, welcomed within the parrot's divine aura.   

The voice she heard wasn't Loulou's squawk, repeating his three phrases, nor the priest's drone, nor the wind rattling the loose tiles. It was a sound that encompassed all sounds and yet was utter silence – a vibration felt within the soul. It was the murmur of the waves at Trouville, the bellowing of the oxen she had faced down, the tolling of the bells for Virginia’s first communion, the gentle cooing of doves. It spoke not in words but in pure feeling: acceptance, peace, homecoming.   

She tried to lift a hand, the one that had scrubbed floors, mended clothes, dressed wounds, comforted children, and clutched a rosary. It felt impossibly heavy, bound to the damp bolster. But her spirit, light as a feather, detached itself. She floated towards the magnificent bird, no longer blind or deaf, no longer tethered to the failing body or the decaying house. The blue incense smoke swirled around her, becoming luminous clouds. As she drew closer, the great parrot opened its beak, not to bite or screech, but in welcome. And as Félicité exhaled her last, shallow breath, she was enveloped in a blaze of emerald and gold, finally united with the simple, misunderstood god she had fashioned from love, loss, and a stuffed bird. Outside, the procession moved on, unaware of the quiet miracle that had transpired in the derelict house.   

Ending 2: The Closing Door

Félicité’s final breath was less a gasp, more a sigh, a quiet letting go that Mother Simon, busy wiping crumbs from her mouth downstairs, didn't hear. The bells of Corpus Christi faded as the procession moved further down the street. Upstairs, in the dim, musty room, the silence settled heavily, disturbed only by the buzzing of flies drawn to the decay, both of the house and its last inhabitant. The stuffed parrot, Loulou, perched awkwardly on the flower-draped box, its glass eye staring blankly, its gilded nut catching no light.   

Eventually, Mother Simon came back upstairs. Finding Félicité still and cold, she crossed herself with a practiced, almost indifferent air. Death was common, especially among the old and poor. She checked for breath, touched the cooling cheek, then pulled the thin sheet over Félicité’s face. Her first thought was practical: notify the priest, find someone to deal with the body. Her second thought was of Loulou. The priest had consented to its place on the makeshift altar, but Félicité had promised it to him upon her death. Mother Simon eyed the bird. It was a wreck – moth-eaten, shedding wadding, a wing broken. Hardly a fitting gift for the church, even if the cure had humoured the dying woman.   

The priest arrived, administered the last rites belatedly, his expression impassive. He listened to Mother Simon’s brief account, murmured condolences, and asked about Félicité’s final wishes. “She wanted you to have the bird, Father,” Mother Simon said, gesturing towards Loulou with a doubtful expression. The priest looked at the sorry specimen. He remembered Félicité’s peculiar devotion, her conflation of the parrot with the Holy Spirit, her deafness making confession awkward. A simple soul, perhaps touched by God, perhaps merely addled by age and isolation. “Thank you, Mother Simon,” he said smoothly. “But perhaps… perhaps it brought her comfort. Let it remain with her effects.” He had no desire for the decaying thing in the presbytery.   

Fabu, summoned earlier to receive Félicité’s confused apology about Loulou’s death, heard the news with a shrug. He hadn’t killed the bird, hadn’t thought much about the old woman beyond her occasional eccentricities. Her death, like her life, caused barely a ripple beyond the damp walls of the Aubain house.   

Paul and his wife were notified, more as a formality concerning the house they still hadn’t sold. The daughter-in-law, who had previously ransacked the place, expressed mild annoyance at the inconvenience. They arranged for the cheapest possible burial. Félicité, who had followed Madame Aubain’s hearse with such devotion, had only Mother Simon and two other elderly neighbours follow hers to an unmarked corner of the cemetery, far from Virginia’s pink marble column.   

Mother Simon cleared out the room. Félicité’s few clothes were bundled for rags. The rosaries and medals  were tossed into a box. Virginia’s moth-eaten hat, Monsieur’s old coat, the box of shells  – all deemed worthless. When she reached Loulou, Mother Simon hesitated. Then, with a grimace, she detached the bird from its perch, carried it downstairs, and dropped it unceremoniously onto the rubbish pile accumulating in the yard, ready to be carted away. The glass eye stared up at the indifferent sky for a moment before being covered by discarded papers. The door to Félicité's room was closed, the door to the house soon locked. Within a few years, no one in Pont-l’Evêque could quite recall the name of the simple, deaf servant who had lived for half a century in the old Aubain house, her life erased as completely as chalk from a slate.   

Ending 3: The Last Word

The air in Félicité’s room grew thick and heavy, saturated with the smell of incense and impending death. Félicité lay still, her chest barely moving. Mother Simon, having positioned the sorry figure of Loulou on the improvised altar, felt a sudden chill despite the closeness of the day. She muttered a quick prayer, more out of habit than conviction, glancing nervously at the dying woman and the stuffed bird.   

Félicité's lips moved, but no sound escaped – perhaps a final prayer, perhaps a name whispered to the shadows she sometimes addressed. Her eyes, though clouded by blindness, seemed fixed intently on the parrot. Suddenly, a tremor ran through her frail body. A faint sigh escaped her lips, and she was still.   

Mother Simon approached the bed. "Gone to her Maker," she murmured, reaching out a hand to close Félicité's unseeing eyes. As she did, a faint rustling sound came from the altar. Mother Simon froze, her hand hovering over Félicité’s face. She turned slowly towards the sound.

Loulou, the dilapidated parrot, seemed… different. Had a draft caught its loose feathers? Or was it imagination, the effect of the incense and the solemnity of death? But the rustling came again, louder this time. And then, incredibly, the bird’s head, stiffly mounted askew, seemed to twitch. Its glass eye  glinted, not with reflected light, but with something that looked disturbingly like awareness.   

Mother Simon backed away, her heart pounding. This was nonsense. The bird was dead, stuffed, decaying. Félicité's strange obsession  was contagious, addling her own senses. She crossed herself vigorously.   

Then, a voice, cracked and dry, yet unnervingly clear, filled the small room. It wasn't Félicité's loud tone, born of deafness, nor Mother Simon's own trembling whisper. It sounded eerily like the parrot's learned phrases, yet deeper, resonant.   

"Je vous salue, Félicité." (I salute you, Félicité.)

It wasn’t one of Loulou’s usual lines. He said "I salute you, Marie!". Mother Simon stared, mouth agape, at the bird. Its beak hadn't moved. The voice seemed to hang in the air, echoing slightly. Was it the priest outside? No, the procession had passed. Was it a trick of acoustics, some sound from the street distorted?   

The glint in the glass eye faded. The parrot slumped slightly on its perch, looking, if possible, even more decrepit than before. The moment, charged with an impossible energy, dissolved back into the ordinary, musty silence of the death-room.   

Mother Simon, shaking, finished closing Félicité's eyes and drew the sheet over her face. She didn't look at the parrot again. When the priest arrived later, she recounted Félicité's peaceful passing, omitting the strange event entirely. Who would believe her? They'd say she was imagining things, or worse, that she was as simple-minded as poor Félicité herself.

Yet, as she tidied the room days later, preparing for the removal of Félicité's meagre possessions, she couldn't bring herself to throw Loulou away immediately. She wrapped it carefully in a cloth and hid it at the bottom of a chest. Perhaps it was just a trick of the light, a sound from outside, her own overwrought nerves. But sometimes, in the quiet of the night, she thought she heard it again, that dry, cracked voice: Je vous salue, Félicité. A final, inexplicable tribute to a life of simple devotion.

Ending 4: The Tapestry of Memory

Silence. Or what passed for silence in Félicité’s failing ears – a low, persistent buzz  overlaid with the faint, rhythmic chanting from the street below. She floated, adrift in the dim space between sleep and waking, life and death. The damp chill of the bolster beneath her head  was a distant anchor. Her body felt remote, a heavy, useless thing she was preparing to leave behind.   

Her blindness  was no impediment now; images bloomed behind her closed eyelids, vivid and sharp, more real than the shadowy room. Not chronological, but woven together like threads in an old tapestry. Theodore's arm around her waist on a dusty road, the scent of hay and youthful promises soon broken. The shock of cold sea water at Trouville, Virginia shrieking with laughter beside her. The terrifying bellow of the bull in the fog, the desperate scramble over the ditch. Paul, bravely leaving for college, then later, awkward and distant, finally a stranger with an aloof wife.   

Faces drifted past. Madame Aubain, pinching francs, weeping for Virginia, that one startling moment of shared grief over moth-eaten clothes. Monsieur Bourais, smelling of snuff, explaining the incomprehensible map with its tiny black dot for Havana. Her sister Nastasie, appearing with children, exploiting her kindness. Old Colmiche, dying in his hovel, his grateful, trembling hands. Fabu’s tattooed arms, threatening Loulou. The priest, his face indistinct during catechism lessons, later in the dim vestry for confession.   

And Victor. Always Victor. His cheerful face returning from the sea, the smell of brine and adventure clinging to him. His departure on the Honfleur packet, a dwindling black spot against the moonlit water. The crushing finality of the letter – "He had died". The phantom pain of that loss echoed through all the others.

Loulou. A splash of colour in the grey monotony. Perched on her finger, pecking her lips. His frantic squawks during thunderstorms. The frantic search when he was lost. The arduous journey to Honfleur with his small, still body. His eventual return, stuffed and strangely majestic. The prayers offered before him, a conduit to something vast and incomprehensible she called the Holy Ghost.   

The buzz in her ears intensified, coalescing into a single, high-pitched sound – like Loulou’s screech, but magnified, purified. The images swirled faster: the Host dissolving on Virginia's tongue, the waves cresting, the wind singing, the parrot's wings beating. Green, gold, blue, pink. All colours merging into a brilliant, welcoming light.   

Was this Paradise? Was this the Holy Ghost? Was it Loulou, waiting for her? It didn't matter. Labels fell away. Explanations were unnecessary. There was only the light, the sound, the feeling of being gathered up, cherished. The last thread of memory wasn't of sorrow or hardship, but of simple connection – a hand held, a shared meal, a bird on her shoulder. Her final, unuttered thought was not a prayer, but a name, breathed into the luminous silence: "Loulou." Then the buzzing stopped. The light filled everything. And Félicité was gone.   

Ending 5: Just Another Passing

The Corpus Christi procession, with its incense, banners, and solemn chants, passed by the crumbling Aubain house. Inside, on the second floor, Félicité lay dying. The pneumonia that had settled in her chest made each breath a painful, shallow struggle. Mother Simon, having dutifully fetched the priest and placed the tattered parrot, Loulou, near the bed as requested, felt no particular sense of solemnity. She had seen death often. It was messy, inconvenient, and usually, unremarked.

Félicité's mind wandered through fog. She mumbled names – Virginia, Victor  – indistinctly. Her brief moment of clarity when accusing Fabu had passed, leaving only confusion. She did not perceive the incense or the chanting. Her deafness  had long since shut out the world, leaving only the tinnitus buzz  and the phantom sounds of her isolated inner life. There was no vision of a glorious parrot opening the gates of heaven. There was only the tightening in her chest, the taste of blood from her earlier coughing fits, the dampness of the bolster.   

Her last conscious sensation was irritation. A fly buzzed persistently near her face. She lacked the strength even to twitch it away. Then, a final, rattling cough, a brief stoppage of breath, and silence. The fly landed on her open, unseeing eye.

Mother Simon found her some time later. "Ah, well," she sighed, performing the necessary tasks with brisk efficiency. She closed the eyes, straightened the limbs, pulled up the sheet. The room felt cold and damp. She glanced at Loulou, perched absurdly amid wilting flowers scavenged from the garden. The creature looked pathetic, shedding stuffing, its bright colours faded, its glass eye filmed with dust. A testament to decay, nothing more. Félicité's strange devotion to it  seemed suddenly pitiable, the delusion of a lonely, failing mind.   

The priest came, offered prayers, his words routine. He politely declined the offer of the parrot, suggesting it be disposed of with Félicité's other effects. There was little of value. Paul and his wife sent instructions for the disposal of the body and the securing of the house, their main concern being the eventual sale of the property.   

Félicité's funeral was brief, sparsely attended. A few neighbours, Mother Simon, no family. She was buried quickly, another anonymous soul returned to the earth. Mother Simon cleared the room, sweeping indifference. The few keepsakes – the shell box, the pictures, Virginia’s hat  – were swept into a sack with the rubbish. Loulou was the last to go. Mother Simon held it for a moment, feeling the brittle feathers, the loose wadding. With a shrug, she tossed it onto the pile. It landed with a soft thud, one broken wing askew.   

The house remained empty, shutters closed, slowly succumbing to damp and neglect. Félicité’s half-century of service, her quiet endurance, her profound losses, her simple, eccentric faith  – all forgotten. She was merely the old, deaf servant who had died upstairs. Life in Pont-l’Evêque went on, unchanged. The parrot lay buried in refuse, returning to dust, just like its devoted mistress. There was no miracle, no transcendence, only the relentless, indifferent cycle of life and decay.
