Ending 1: The Dropcloth's Truth
The painter remained perched on his stepladder, the acrid smell of gunpowder sharp in the sterile air. Below him lay the tableau of rebellion and despair: the architect of population control, the cheerful hostess of death, and the desperate father who chose defiance over compliance. Three bodies. Room for three babies. A neat, brutal equation.   

He looked from the carnage to the mural, his supposed masterpiece. The serene figures tending the manicured garden, the smiling faces—even Dr. Hitz's newly completed portrait —seemed obscene now. Leora Duncan's half-finished face on the pruner seemed frozen mid-platitude. It was a lie, this painted paradise. A beautiful, intricate, government-sanctioned lie.   

Slowly, deliberately, the painter descended the ladder. He walked past the bodies without a glance, his eyes fixed on the mural. He picked up a scraper, its edge keen and bright. With methodical strokes, he began to undo his work. Hitz's handsome face dissolved under the blade. Leora Duncan's budding portrait vanished. He scraped away the gardeners, the pruners, the peaceful couples enjoying the "happy, roomy, clean, rich planet". He worked with a quiet intensity, the rhythmic shhk-shhk of the scraper the only sound in the waiting room.   

He didn't stop until the wall was nearly blank, scarred with the ghosts of the figures it once held. Then, he turned his attention to his dropcloth, the one he'd called a more honest picture of life. It was stained, splattered, worn – a map of accidents, efforts, and failures. He carefully folded it.   

The orderly from earlier poked his head in, drawn perhaps by the uncharacteristic silence following the shots. His eyes widened at the scene – the bodies, the ruined mural. "Grandpa! What the hell happened? What did you do?"

The painter looked at the orderly, his face impassive. He held up the folded dropcloth. "I decided to paint something honest," he said, his voice level. He gestured towards the blank wall. "This needs priming. Then, I'll hang this."

He thought of Wehling's final, desperate act. Messy. Necessary? Perhaps. He thought of the triplets, now granted life at the cost of three others. Was this balance? Or just chaos wearing a uniform?   

He wouldn't call "2 B R 0 2 B". Not today. He had work to do. A new commission, self-assigned. He would paint the truth, or at least, a truth. It wouldn't be pretty. It wouldn't depict a garden. It would look like the dropcloth. Like the floor beneath his feet. Like the silence after a gunshot. He dipped his brush in a can of plain, obliterating white. The mural had depicted a fantasy of control; his new work would reflect the messy, uncontrollable reality Wehling had unveiled. It wouldn't earn him accolades, but it would be his. And in a world built on convenient lies, perhaps that was the only honour worth having.   

Ending 2: The Unseen Stroke
The painter sat frozen, the scene below imprinted on his retinas. Wehling’s final act wasn’t just murder and suicide; it was a scream against the suffocating order, a rejection of the cold arithmetic that governed life and death. For years, the painter had cultivated a shell of cynicism, mocking the sanitized world he was paid to beautify. He’d despised the mural, the system, the cheerful euphemisms like "Ethical Suicide Studios". But he hadn't done anything. He'd just painted.   

Now, confronted with the raw consequence of that system – a father driven to triple murder and suicide to save his children  – the painter felt a crack spiderweb through his detachment. Wehling hadn't just made room; he'd made a statement. A bloody, irrefutable statement about the value of life, all life, against the state's sterile decree.   

He climbed down, his movements stiff. The smell of cordite hung heavy. He looked at the mural, specifically at the section where Leora Duncan's portrait was meant to be, next to the now-obliterated Dr. Hitz. Her figure, the pruner, was still faceless.   

An idea, quiet and dangerous, sparked within him. He picked up his finest brush, the one he used for capturing the glint in an eye, the curve of a lip. He mixed a colour – not the official purple of the Termination Bureau, nor the vibrant hues of the false garden. He mixed a shade of grey, the colour of Wehling's face, the colour of ashes, the colour of doubt.   

He wouldn't paint Leora Duncan's face. Instead, onto the blank oval where her officially sanctioned features should go, he painted three tiny, identical faces. Barely discernible from the ground, but clear from his vantage point. The faces of triplets. A subtle, defiant alteration to the state-approved narrative. A tiny testament to the lives Wehling had fought for, hidden in plain sight within the monument to the very system that condemned them.

It was a small act, likely to go unnoticed or be painted over by the next functionary. It wouldn't change the law. It wouldn't bring anyone back. But it was his act. A rejection of the bland perfection, an acknowledgment of the messy, tragic, beautiful desire to simply live.   

He cleaned his brushes, packed his paints. As he left the waiting room, stepping carefully around the spreading pools of blood, he didn't look back at the mural. He didn't need to. He carried the image – the official lie subtly marred by a secret truth – within him. He might still be a gloomy old duck, but something had shifted. The dropcloth wasn't just grime anymore; it held the texture of resistance. And for the first time in a long time, the painter felt the faint, dangerous flicker of purpose.   

Ending 3: Order Restored
The painter remained still, a gargoyle overlooking a modern tragedy. The silence that followed the shots  was profound, unnatural in the usually bustling hospital wing. It didn't last long.   

Doors hissed open. Figures appeared, not doctors or nurses, but men and women in the crisp, grey uniforms of the Federal Bureau of Termination's internal security. They moved with practiced efficiency, their faces impassive, their steps quiet on the linoleum. They didn't seem surprised or horrified; they seemed… prepared.

One knelt by Dr. Hitz, another by Leora Duncan, a third by Wehling. Scanners whirred softly. Samples were taken. Someone spoke quietly into a wrist communicator. "Incident confirmed. Waiting Room 7. Code L-3. Initiate Protocol Sigma."   

The painter watched, unnoticed on his perch. Protocol Sigma, apparently, involved swift, silent cleanup. Bio-hazard teams arrived with opaque bags and cleansing units. The bodies were zipped away with bureaucratic detachment. Machines hummed, scrubbing the floor, purifying the air, erasing every physical trace of the violence. It was chillingly efficient, like tidying up a minor spill.

A stern-faced woman in a higher-ranking grey uniform approached the painter. Her eyes swept over the mural, lingering for a moment on the blank space where Leora Duncan's face should have been. "You," she said, her voice clipped. "You were here the whole time?"   

The painter nodded slowly.

"You saw what occurred?"

He nodded again.

"A tragic malfunction," the woman stated flatly. "Mr. Wehling suffered a sudden, severe psychotic break. A known, though rare, side effect of Paternal Stress Syndrome under Code Triple-Zero regulations. He regrettably overpowered Ms. Duncan and Dr. Hitz before taking his own life. A terrible, isolated incident." She didn't ask; she informed.

The painter looked at her, then at the mural. The lie was already being painted, cleaner and quicker than he could manage with oils. "Isolated," he echoed, his voice devoid of inflection.

"Your work on the mural will continue, of course," she said, gesturing dismissively at the nearly finished piece. "We need symbols of stability. Especially now. Finish Ms. Duncan's portrait. And Dr. Hitz's. Ensure they look… serene." She paused. "Your silence regarding the… specifics… of the malfunction is naturally expected. For the public good."

The painter understood. The system would absorb this. Wehling's act of desperation would be filed away, explained away, sanitized. The triplets would live, but the 'why' would be rewritten. The perfect world Hitz envisioned  demanded perfect stories, even if they had to be fabricated over fresh bloodstains.   

He picked up his brush again. He would paint Leora Duncan's face, give her the serene, empty smile the state required. He would repaint Hitz's portrait, restoring the image of benevolent omnipotence. He would do his job. But as he painted, blending the colours to recreate the official lie, he knew the foul dropcloth  and the memory of Wehling's face held more truth than anything he would ever put on this wall. Order was restored, but it felt colder and more brittle than ever.   

Ending 4: The Number Reconsidered
High on his ladder, the painter stared down at the three cooling bodies. Wehling, Hitz, Duncan. A father desperate for his children, a doctor proud of the system, a hostess facilitating its function. All gone in moments. Wehling hadn't called the number. He hadn't gone quietly to the 'Happy Hooligan' or the 'Ethical Suicide Studios'. He'd made his own exit, taking two pillars of the establishment with him. A messy business, as the orderly had said.   

The painter thought of his own long life, his cynicism, his quiet contempt for the world he painted. He, too, had often contemplated the end. Not via the Bureau's cheerful chambers, but perhaps a fall from a ladder, a deliberate overdose of paint thinner – a "do-it-yourselfer". He understood the weariness, the feeling that the world, even this supposedly perfect one, was a fraud.   

But Wehling's act wasn't born of weariness alone. It was rage. Love. A primal scream for his offspring. He hadn't just chosen death; he'd chosen life – for his triplets. He’d paid the ultimate price, thrice over, to defy the law that demanded sacrifice.   

The painter looked at his own hands, stained with decades of paint. He had captured likenesses, created illusions of order and beauty. But what had he lived for? His art felt hollow now, his scorn a shield against a life he hadn't fully embraced. He'd scoffed at the mural's depiction of life, but what was his own alternative? A grimy dropcloth  and a lonely existence?   

He descended the ladder, his knees cracking. He walked over to the wall phone, the one near the entrance. His fingers hovered over the keypad. 2. B. R. 0. 2. B. To be or not to be. The number felt different now. Not just an escape route, but a symbol of the society's cold calculation, the very thing Wehling had fought against.   

He thought of the triplets, now orphans, but alive. He thought of Wehling's grandfather, spared a trip to the 'Catbox'. Wehling's actions, born of desperation, had paradoxically affirmed life, albeit through death.   

The painter pulled his hand back from the phone. He wasn't ready for the void, not yet. The scene below was horrific, proof of the system's cruelty. But it was also proof of passion, of a desperate, messy love that defied regulation. It was ugly, tragic, and profoundly human.

He went back to the mural. He looked at the blank faces yet to be filled. Maybe he wouldn't just paint portraits of the 'important' people. Maybe he'd paint Wehling. Not as a murderer, but as a father. Maybe he'd paint the faces of the triplets, hidden amongst the leaves. Maybe he'd paint the dropcloth after all, not as a symbol of despair, but as a testament to the complex, stained, undeniable value of existence. He picked up a brush. He didn't know exactly what he would paint, but he knew it wouldn't be a call to the number. It would be an answer.   

Ending 5: The Accidental Gardeners
The painter watched the scene unfold below, a grotesque inversion of the pastoral ideal he was painting. Three shots, three bodies, three vacancies created for three new lives. The universe, it seemed, had a brutal sense of symmetry.   

He expected sirens, alarms, the efficient grey uniforms of the Bureau. But nothing happened. The waiting room remained steeped in silence, broken only by the faint hum of the hospital's ventilation. It was as if the shots had occurred in a vacuum.   

Then, a door opened – not the main entrance, nor the one Hitz had used, but a smaller service door concealed near the base of the mural. A medical droid whirred out, tray laden with gleaming instruments. It stopped, sensors taking in the scene. Its optical sensors blinked blue, then red. It emitted a series of confused beeps.   

Following the droid came a nurse, looking flustered. "Doctor, the Wehling triplets are stabilized, but the ident-tags aren't registering a corresponding volunteer receipt yet..." Her voice trailed off as she saw the bodies. She gasped, dropping a chart.

Before the painter could speak, before the nurse could scream, the droid initiated its override protocol. Its programming, clearly encountering data outside its parameters (triple homicide in a designated quiet zone?), seemed to default to its core function within that specific location: facilitate life.

Its manipulator arms extended. Gently, ignoring the blood, it approached Wehling's body. With unnerving precision, it used a laser scalpel to snip the revolver from his cooling hand, depositing it neatly in a biohazard pouch. Then, it nudged Wehling's limbs, folding his arms across his chest. It did the same for Leora Duncan  and Dr. Hitz. Three bodies, arranged almost tidily on the floor.   

The painter stared, dumbfounded. The nurse was frozen, hand over her mouth.

The droid then turned its attention to the mural. Its sensors scanned the painted garden. Perhaps mistaking the bodies for unexpected organic obstructions, or perhaps following some obscure tidiness subroutine, it extended a cleaning appendage. It began meticulously wiping the blood spatter from the painted leaves nearest the floor, its movements gentle, almost reverent. It was tending the garden.   

The painter started to laugh. A dry, rasping sound that echoed in the stillness. Here was the ultimate absurdity. A man commits triple murder-suicide to ensure his children live, defying the sterile system of population control, and the first response is a machine, programmed for life-support, tidying the scene and polishing the fake leaves of a fake garden.   

The nurse finally found her voice, a strangled whisper. "What... what do we do?"

The painter looked from the droid diligently 'gardening' around the corpses to the mural's depiction of ordered tranquility. He gestured with his brush. "We wait," he said, the laughter still bubbling beneath his words. "Apparently, the garden tends itself." He dipped his brush in paint. He had faces to finish, a lie to maintain. But now, the lie felt different – not just sinister, but utterly, hilariously, tragically absurd. The perfect world wasn't just cruel; it was ridiculous. And maybe, just maybe, that was the biggest joke of all
