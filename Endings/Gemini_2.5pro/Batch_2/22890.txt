Ending 1: The Weight of "If"

I thanked Van Manderpootz, the professor’s cheerful demeanor a stark contrast to the icy grip of terror still squeezing my chest. "Horrible!" I'd murmured, the word feeling inadequate to describe the chaos, the screams, the green surge of water engulfing the observation room. He’d chuckled at my use of "we", not knowing – or perhaps knowing all too well, in his academic way – about Joanna. I didn't enlighten him. I simply bade him good-night and went home, the image of her pale face, her closed silver eyes, burned into my mind.   

The city outside was the same, vibrant and indifferent. People hurried to their destinations, blissfully unaware of the countless alternate realities flickering around them, each a testament to a different choice, a missed connection, a moment of tardiness or punctuality. My father's voice echoed in my head, sharp and critical. "Dixon," he'd said, "you have no conception whatever of time. None whatever". How wrong he was. In the space of those few simulated minutes, I had experienced an eternity of consequence. My lateness, that lifelong albatross, had saved me. But at what cost? The faces of the unrescued hundreds  – they were real, even if my presence among them in that specific reality was not. And Joanna. Was there a Joanna Caldwell in this reality? Had she, perhaps, been on that flight anyway? Or had her fate, too, been altered by the five minutes the rocket didn't wait for me?   

The uncertainty was a new kind of torment, a subtle, insidious pain that gnawed at me far worse than my usual vague guilt over missed appointments and frustrated fathers. I had hated not finding out, but now that I had found out, the knowledge was a heavy cloak I couldn't shed. I saw "if" everywhere. If I had taken a different route home that night. If I had answered my father's call earlier. If, if, if. The subjunctivisor had opened a door, and now I couldn't close it. The world of "if"  wasn't just an academic curiosity; it was a parallel existence, a silent accusation.   

I tried to return to my life, to the comfortable rhythm of being Dixon Wells, the charmingly unreliable son of N.J. Wells. But the subjunctivisor had irrevocably changed my perception of time. Every tick of the clock was a branching point, every decision a pivot into a multitude of other possibilities. My lateness was no longer a simple character quirk; it was a force, a determinant of fate. And the fate I had glimpsed was a horrific one.

Sleep offered little respite. When I closed my eyes, I saw the green water, felt the jarring impact. I saw Joanna’s face, pale and still. I would wake in a cold sweat, the silence of my apartment a stark contrast to the simulated screams. I avoided my father, unable to bear his casual remarks about my lack of punctuality, knowing what I now knew about the terrifying power of a few minutes.   

Van Manderpootz, in his pursuit of his "colossal"  autobiography, was dismantling the subjunctivisor. He believed it had served its purpose. But for me, its purpose had just begun. It had shown me the fragility of my own existence, the profound impact of seemingly insignificant actions, and the terrible beauty and horror of the paths not taken. I was saved, but I was also haunted, forever burdened by the weight of the "if." I knew then that my life would never be the same. The subjunctivisor was gone, but the alternate realities it had revealed were now a permanent landscape of my mind.   

Ending 2: A Second Chance, A Different Path

"Horrible!" I stammered, pulling myself back from the vivid, terrifying tableau the subjunctivisor had painted. The screams, the impact, the final, drowning surge of water  – it was still too real. Van Manderpootz, bless his eccentric soul, just chuckled about my use of "we". He couldn't possibly understand the connection I'd felt with Joanna, the brief, intense spark that had ignited in the face of impending doom. I mumbled my thanks and practically fled his cluttered laboratory.   

Walking out into the cool evening air, I felt like I had been granted a reprieve. My chronic lateness, the bane of my father's existence, had saved my life. It was an ironic twist of fate that wasn't lost on me. But the image of Joanna, her silver eyes closed, lingered. In that alternate reality, she was gone. In this one… was she here? Had she taken a different flight? Had she, perhaps, missed the Baikal too, for reasons of her own?   

The uncertainty, for once, didn't feel like a pang of remorse or a futile doubt. It felt like hope. The subjunctivisor had shown me a world that could have been, a world of tragedy. But it had also shown me Joanna, a possibility of connection, of something real and meaningful beyond the superficiality of my usual social circles.   

My father's voice, with its familiar refrain of my lack of punctuality, no longer held the same power. Time was money, he'd declared. But I had seen a reality where all the money in the world couldn't buy you an extra minute, where time ran out in the most brutal way imaginable. My perspective had shifted.   

I knew what I had to do. I couldn't just forget Joanna. Even if she was just a construct of the subjunctivisor, a ghost in the machine, the feelings she had evoked were real. I had to find her.   

The next day, I started with the passenger manifest of the Baikal. It felt morbid, but I had to know if a Joanna Caldwell had been booked on that flight. A knot of anxiety tightened in my stomach as I waited for the information. When it finally came, I scanned the list with trembling hands. There it was. Joanna Caldwell. But next to her name, in stark black letters, was a note: "Did not board."

A wave of relief, so potent it made me dizzy, washed over me. She hadn't been on the flight. She was, presumably, alive. But where? The manifest offered no further details.

My search began in earnest. I used every resource available to me as Dixon Wells of the N.J. Wells Corporation. I hired private investigators, pulled strings, followed every lead, no matter how small. My father, noticing my newfound purpose and surprising efficiency, was bewildered. "What's gotten into you, Dixon?" he'd asked. "You're almost… on time."

I just smiled. Time had taken on a new meaning for me. It was a precious commodity, not to be wasted.

Weeks turned into months. The search was frustratingly slow. Joanna Caldwell wasn't a public figure. She was an artist, someone who seemed to value her privacy. I almost gave up multiple times, the vastness of the city and the slimness of the leads weighing on me. But then I would remember her silver eyes, her amused smile, the easy way we'd connected, and I would press on.   

Finally, a breakthrough. One of the investigators tracked down a former roommate. Joanna, they said, had decided against taking the Baikal at the last minute. Something about a bad feeling, a missed connection with a friend, a change of plans. She was still in the city, working at a small gallery downtown, saving up for her trip to Paris.   

My heart hammered against my ribs. I went to the gallery that afternoon. It was a small, unassuming place, filled with vibrant, challenging art. And there, talking to a customer, was Joanna.

She looked up as I entered, and her eyes, those unforgettable silver eyes, widened in recognition. "You!" she exclaimed, a surprised smile spreading across her face. "The chronically late man from the… well, you know."   

I grinned, feeling a lightness I hadn't felt in a long time. "Joanna," I said, walking towards her. "It's a long story, but I think… I think we were meant to meet again."

And as I stood there, under the gaze of her amused, intelligent eyes, I knew that my lateness, for the first time in my life, had led me exactly where I needed to be.   

Ending 3: The Philosopher of Lateness

"Horrible!" I gasped, the word wrenched from my lungs. The subjunctivisor screen  faded to the familiar, cluttered reality of Van Manderpootz's lab. He was scribbling on the edge of the table, unfazed by the simulated catastrophe I had just witnessed. He made a comment about "we", and I just shook my head, unable to articulate the profound impact of seeing Joanna disappear into the chaos.   

I left the university in a daze. The Baikal disaster  was no longer just a新闻 headline; it was a visceral experience, a personal horror. And my lateness, the lifelong source of my father's exasperation, had been my unexpected savior.   

The irony of it was not lost on me. For years, I had been chided, criticized, even ridiculed for my inability to adhere to schedules. Time was a rigid, unyielding master, and I was its perpetually failing student. But in the face of a true, life-or-death crisis, my disregard for punctuality had been the very thing that kept me from being one of the unrescued hundreds.   

This realization sparked something within me. My lateness wasn't a flaw; it was a characteristic. Perhaps, even, a form of subtle rebellion against a world obsessed with the relentless march of the clock. Van Manderpootz saw time as money, a commodity to be earned and spent. My father saw it as a moral imperative, a sign of discipline and respectability. But I had seen time as something far more fluid, far more unpredictable. It could be stretched or compressed, a matter of life or death, a canvas for countless alternate realities.   

I began to explore this idea, not just in my own life, but in a broader sense. I read philosophy, physics, even poetry, looking for different perspectives on time. I found kindred spirits in unexpected places – artists who saw time as a malleable medium, scientists who explored its relativistic nature, writers who bent it to their will in narrative.

I started writing. At first, it was just for myself, a way to process the experience in the subjunctivisor and its aftermath. I wrote about the feeling of being caught between realities, about the "ghostly infinities"  of "if." I wrote about Joanna, the beautiful stranger who existed only in a hypothetical past, a poignant symbol of a connection that was and wasn't.   

Slowly, my writing evolved. It became less about my personal experience and more about the nature of time itself, about the human relationship with schedules, deadlines, and the illusion of control. I wrote about the societal pressure to be on time, the anxiety it creates, and the unexpected freedom that can come from letting go.

My father, of course, was baffled by this new phase. "Writing, Dixon? What about the firm? What about your responsibilities?"  He still didn't understand. My responsibilities had shifted. I felt a responsibility to explore this profound truth that had been revealed to me – that time is not a tyrant, but a complex, multifaceted phenomenon.   

I published my first essay anonymously. It was titled "The Philosophy of Lateness." To my surprise, it resonated with people. It sparked conversations, debates, even a few angry letters from the perpetually punctual. But many people, I found, secretly harbored a similar feeling of being out of sync with the world's relentless rhythm.

I continued to write, eventually publishing a book. I became known, ironically, as a thoughtful commentator on time and its discontents. My chronic lateness, once a source of shame and conflict, became a kind of signature, a lived example of the ideas I explored.

I never forgot Joanna. She remained a wistful presence in my thoughts, a reminder of the fragile beauty of fleeting moments and the profound impact of chance. I often wondered about her, about the reality she inhabited. But I no longer felt the desperate need to find her. She had served her purpose in my story, a catalyst for a profound shift in my understanding of the world and my place in it.

Van Manderpootz published his autobiography, "Magnificus sed non superbus". I bought a copy, of course. It was filled with his usual grand pronouncements and self-congratulatory anecdotes. He was still living in his world of concrete achievements and historical impact. I, on the other hand, had found my place in the more nebulous, philosophical realm of "if," forever changed by the brief, terrifying glimpse into a reality where I had, for once, been on time.   

Ending 4: The Pursuit of Joanna

"Horrible!" I choked out, the echo of screams still ringing in my ears. Van Manderpootz, ever the detached observer, simply twinkled at my use of "we". He couldn't know. He couldn't possibly grasp the reality of those fleeting moments with Joanna, the unexpected connection that had blossomed in the shadow of disaster. I thanked him numbly and left, the vibrant image of her silver eyes  and amused smile  seared into my memory.   

The subjunctivisor had shown me a terrible truth: my lateness, that lifelong habit, had saved me from the Baikal disaster. But it had also shown me a tantalizing glimpse of what I had missed – Joanna. She was real to me, more real than many people I encountered in my everyday life. The brief time we had together in that simulated reality had been more genuine, more engaging, than months of forced social interactions.   

I couldn't just let her go. The subjunctivisor might be dismantled, Van Manderpootz might be focused on his magnum opus, but I was focused on one thing: finding Joanna Caldwell.   

My father's complaints about my punctuality  faded into the background. The truth was, my life had felt a bit pointless before. A string of meaningless social events, a vague sense of obligation to the family business, a chronic inability to be on time for anything that truly mattered. But Joanna mattered.   

My search began with the scant information I had: her name, that she was an artist, and that she was going to Paris for a year of study. I started by contacting art schools in Paris, a daunting task given the sheer number of institutions. I also reached out to art galleries and cultural organizations, hoping to find a trace of her.   

It was like searching for a ghost. The Joanna Caldwell of the subjunctivisor was a specific person, a product of a particular set of circumstances. The real Joanna Caldwell, if she existed, could be anyone, anywhere.

Months passed. My initial fervor began to wane, replaced by a weary determination. There were dead ends, false leads, moments of crushing disappointment. My friends thought I was crazy. My father thought I had finally lost my mind. Perhaps I had. But I couldn't shake the feeling that she was out there, that our connection in the subjunctivisor wasn't just a random anomaly, but a sign, a promise of something real.

I took a leave of absence from the N.J. Wells Corporation. My father was furious, but I didn't care. I booked a flight to Paris. It felt like a pilgrimage. I wandered the streets she might have walked, visited the museums she might have studied in, sat in the cafes where she might have sketched. It was a romantic, perhaps foolish, endeavor, but I felt compelled to see the world through her potential eyes.

One rainy afternoon, I was browsing in a small, independent art supply store in the Latin Quarter. As I reached for a tube of cerulean blue, my hand brushed against another. I looked up.

It was her.

Her silver eyes, framed by a shock of velvety brown hair, widened in surprise. A small, amused smile  touched her lips. "Dick?" she said, her voice a familiar melody.   

I stared at her, speechless for a moment. She was real. She was here. "Joanna?" I finally managed.

She laughed, a warm, genuine sound that I remembered perfectly from the subjunctivisor. "The one and only," she said. "Though how you found me all the way here…"

"It's a long story," I said, a wide grin spreading across my face. "A very long story. It involves a subjunctivisor, a missed rocket, and a very persistent search."

We talked for hours that day, sitting in a small cafe, the rain drumming against the windowpane. I told her everything – about the subjunctivisor, the Baikal, our brief, intense encounter in that alternate reality. She listened with a mixture of fascination and disbelief, her eyes sparkling with a hint of the amusement I remembered.

It turned out she had been booked on the Baikal, but a last-minute change of plans, a sudden inspiration for a painting, had made her reschedule. She'd felt a strange sense of relief when she heard about the disaster.   

Our meeting in the subjunctivisor had been a hypothetical echo of a real-world possibility. And now, here we were, in Paris, the city she had dreamed of.   

The connection we had felt in that simulated reality was just as strong, if not stronger, in this one. We were sympathetic spirits, drawn together by an invisible thread of fate, or perhaps just by the sheer improbability of our meeting.   

My search was over. I had found Joanna. And in doing so, I had found a new direction for my life, a purpose beyond my father's expectations and my own aimless existence. My lateness had saved me from a watery grave, but it was the possibility of Joanna, glimpsed in a world of "if," that had truly given me a second chance.

Ending 5: The Catalyst of Change

"Horrible," I whispered, the word a hollow echo in the quiet lab. The subjunctivisor screen was dark, but the images of the Baikal disaster  and Joanna's still face  were burned into my mind. Van Manderpootz, engrossed in his own thoughts, barely registered my departure.   

I went home, but sleep was impossible. The experience in the subjunctivisor had cracked something open within me. For my entire life, I had drifted, a charmingly irresponsible son of a successful businessman, content to live in a state of perpetual, mild tardiness. My father's lectures about time and money  had washed over me, meaningless noise against the backdrop of my comfortable existence.   

But I had seen a reality where my lack of punctuality had meant the difference between life and death. I had seen the faces of the victims, and I had seen Joanna, a connection forged in the crucible of a hypothetical tragedy.   

The casual indifference I had previously felt towards time was replaced by a profound respect. Every moment felt precious, every decision weighty. My lateness was no longer a harmless quirk; it was a dangerous gamble, a flirtation with fate.

The experience also highlighted the emptiness of my current life. My days were filled with obligations I didn't care about and social events that felt hollow. The brief, intense connection with Joanna in the subjunctivisor  had shown me what was missing – genuine connection, shared purpose, a life lived with intention.   

I knew I couldn't continue as I had been. The vision of the sinking Baikal was a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the importance of making the most of the time I had been given.

I started small. I set an alarm and, for the first time in years, got to the office on time. My father was so shocked, he almost dropped his coffee. "Dixon," he stammered, "are you… are you feeling alright?"   

I just smiled. "Never better, Father," I said.

Being on time felt… strange. Uncomfortable, even. But it also felt like a small victory, a reclaiming of control.

I didn't stop there. I started taking an active interest in the family business. I attended meetings, asked questions, even offered suggestions. My father was bewildered, but secretly, I think, pleased.

More importantly, I began to seek out meaningful connections. I stopped wasting time on superficial social events and started investing in relationships that mattered. I sought out people who were passionate about their work, who were living their lives with purpose.

I also started painting. It was something I had always been curious about, but had never made time for. I thought of Joanna, her dream of studying in Paris, her dedication to her art. I knew I would never be the artist she was, but the act of creating something, of putting my own vision onto canvas, was incredibly fulfilling.   

I never tried to find the real Joanna Caldwell. Our encounter in the subjunctivisor felt sacred, a moment out of time that had served its purpose as a catalyst for change in my life. To seek her out in this reality felt almost like a violation of that perfect, hypothetical connection. She existed in my mind as a powerful symbol, a reminder of the person I wanted to be.

Van Manderpootz’s autobiography  came out, a testament to his belief in his own historical significance. I read it, and while I still found him amusingly self-important, I also recognized a shared trait – the desire to make an impact, to leave a mark on the world. His was through his inventions and his perceived role in history; mine, I hoped, would be through living a life of purpose and intention, a life no longer defined by my chronic lateness.   

The subjunctivisor was gone, dismantled to make way for the professor's literary ambitions. But its impact on me was permanent. It had shown me the precipice, the potential cost of my complacency. It had shown me a fleeting glimpse of a different kind of connection, a different way of being. And it had spurred me to change, to finally take control of my time, and in doing so, take control of my life. My lateness had once defined me, but now, it was just a memory, a reminder of the moment I chose to step off the path of least resistance and create a new, more meaningful reality for myself.
