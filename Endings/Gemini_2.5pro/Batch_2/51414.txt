Ending 1: The Echo of Time
The ramp touched down with a soft thud on alien soil, yet it felt strangely familiar. Larson, tears still wet on his cheeks, stumbled down the ramp. Mac and I followed, weapons drawn, though against what, we didn't know. The air was crisp, carrying the scent of pine and something else, something floral and sweet that tickled a forgotten memory. We walked towards the low buildings, dominated by a communication tower that looked eerily like something from Earth's late 20th century. As we approached, a figure emerged, silhouetted against the rising sun.

He was old, his face lined and weathered, but his eyes held a spark of recognition that sent a chill down my spine. He wore simple, functional clothing that seemed a blend of past and future. Behind him, more figures emerged, men and women of varying ages, their faces etched with a similar, profound weariness and hope.

The old man raised a hand in greeting. "Welcome, travelers," he said, his voice raspy but clear, the same voice we'd heard over the radio. "Welcome to New Columbia. We've been waiting for you."

Larson stepped forward, his voice a choked whisper. "How... how did you know? Our ship's name? Our language?"

The old man smiled, a sad, knowing expression. "Because, Commander, we are your descendants."

The explanation that followed was almost too incredible to comprehend, yet the logic, in a twisted, relativistic way, held together. When the Albert E. had achieved its incredible velocity, the time dilation effect had been far more extreme than predicted. While only days had passed for us, decades, centuries, millennia had unfolded on Earth. Humanity, facing resource depletion and environmental collapse, had desperately accelerated its own space program, building ships based on the theoretical principles Larson's drive had proven. They had launched colony ships, generation ships, sending their children and their children's children out into the galaxy.

This colony, "New Columbia," was one of the first successful ones, established by those who had left Earth centuries after us, yet arrived here, in their subjective timeframe, long before we did. They had monitored the spacetime distortions caused by our approach, recognized the unique signature of the Larson Drive, and, through generations of research and technological advancement, deciphered our rudimentary communication methods and even our historical records, learning our language and the name of our ship.

They were us, but aged, evolved, separated by an unfathomable gulf of time. They had built a sustainable society, learned from Earth's mistakes, and now, the irony was a bitter pill to swallow. The cynical, misanthropic narrator, who had fled humanity, had arrived at a future built by the very people he disdained. Larson's tears, I finally understood, were not just of reunion, but of the profound, heartbreaking realization that the Tina he mourned had lived out her life, died, and become a distant ancestor to the people standing before him. The universe, it seemed, had a crueler, more intricate sense of humor than I had ever imagined. Our pioneering journey had led us not to the unknown, but to a future that had already happened, a future that welcomed us as relics of a distant, almost forgotten past.    

Ending 2: The Mimic
Larson was halfway down the ramp, his face a mask of bewildered grief and desperate hope, when I saw it. It wasn't the spaceship that caught my eye first, but the tower beside it. It was too perfect, too Earthly, right down to the faded red and white checkerboard pattern at the top. And the buildings – they were precise replicas of early 21st-century architecture, the kind of generic, functional structures you'd find in any terrestrial industrial park. It was a diorama, meticulously crafted, but unsettlingly lifeless.

"Larson, wait!" I yelled, but he was already on the ground, his knees buckling as he ran towards the figures now emerging from the main building. They looked human from this distance, their movements fluid and natural. But as they drew closer, I saw the subtle wrongness. Their smiles were too wide, their eyes held a flat, unblinking intensity. Their clothes, while appearing normal, had an unnatural sheen to them, a manufactured perfection.

The voice from the speaker crackled again, closer now, emanating from the figures themselves. "Welcome to New Columbia. Welcome, Albert E. Come in, please. Welcome to New Columbia."    

But the words were slightly out of sync with the figures' lip movements. A glitch. A tell.

"It's a trap!" Mac screamed from the ship's ramp, raising his weapon.

Too late. The figures reached Larson. There was no embrace, no tearful reunion. Instead, their hands clamped onto him with surprising strength. Larson cried out, not in pain, but in a sudden, dawning horror as the illusion shattered. The "humans" were not flesh and blood, but sophisticated constructs, their skin a synthetic polymer stretched taut over an intricate, whirring mechanism.

A low hum filled the air, and the ground beneath the figures began to glow. From concealed points around the "colony," beams of energy lanced out, converging on the Albert E. Our ship, our sanctuary, shuddered under the impact.

"They're not colonists, they're... collectors!" Mac shouted, scrambling back up the ramp as sparks flew from the ship's hull. "They lure ships in, mimic broadcasts... they're harvesting us!"

I didn't wait. I sprinted back into the ship, the cynical detachment I usually wore like a shield dissolving in a surge of primal fear. We had to get out. Forget Larson, forget New Columbia, forget everything but the cold, hard vacuum of space. It was a terrifying void, yes, but at least it didn't smile with a dead, artificial smile while it dismantled you for parts.

As the ship groaned around me, struggling against the energy beams, I caught a final glimpse of Larson, struggling against his synthetic captors, his face a portrait of a man whose desperate hope had led him to a horrific, silent end. The voice continued its loop, the welcome message now a chilling dirge. "Welcome to New Columbia. Welcome, Albert E." Welcome to the slaughterhouse.

Ending 3: The Silent City
We landed in a clearing, the ramp extending onto overgrown pavement. The spaceship stood before us, massive and silent, its hull weathered and scored as if it had been there for centuries. The buildings surrounding it were intact, but vines crept up their walls, and dust coated every surface visible through the grimy windows. There was no sign of life, no movement, only the whisper of the wind through the tall, unfamiliar trees.

"New Columbia?" I muttered, the name feeling hollow and absurd in the face of this desolation. Mac and I cautiously descended the ramp, leaving a still-sobbing Larson on the ship. My cynicism warred with a growing sense of unease. This wasn't a thriving colony; it was a tomb.

We walked towards the main building, the source of the broadcast. The door hung ajar, creaking in the wind. Inside, the air was stale and cold. Papers lay scattered on desks, covered in a thick layer of dust. Monitors displayed frozen lines of code, ancient and indecipherable. It was as if everyone had simply vanished in the middle of a workday.

We reached the communication room. The equipment was old, jury-rigged, but recognizable. And there, slumped over the console, was a skeleton. Beside it lay a journal. Mac, ever the pragmatist, carefully picked it up.

The journal detailed the fate of the first colony ship, the New Columbia. They had arrived centuries ago, according to Earth time, but only years had passed for them due to their own high-speed journey, albeit slower than ours. They established a base, began exploring. And then, something happened. The entries became increasingly frantic, describing a localized time distortion field emanating from the planet itself, a field that accelerated time for anything within its influence.

The colonists had realized, too late, that their attempts to broadcast a homing beacon for future ships were being caught in this field, amplified and sent out across the galaxy, but also distorted, looping back on itself. The voice we heard was a phantom, an echo of a transmission sent centuries ago, played on a continuous loop by the dying automated systems of the base, caught in the temporal anomaly.

The final entry in the journal was a shaky scrawl: "The field... it's accelerating... we have mere hours... the broadcast... a message in a bottle... hope someone... someday... hears..."

And then, nothing. The colonists had been caught in a localized time loop, living out their final moments on repeat, their city becoming a silent monument to a temporal anomaly. Our arrival, guided by their dying echo, was not a reunion, but a discovery of a tragic, long-past demise. Larson's hope was a cruel mirage, built on the foundation of a graveyard. The universe, it seemed, was not just vast and indifferent, but also capable of weaving patterns of profound, heartbreaking irony. We had traveled across the stars to find not a new beginning, but an ending that had already occurred, leaving only ghosts and the silent hum of a trapped, looping broadcast.

Ending 4: The Shared Burden
As Larson wept on the ramp, overwhelmed by the impossible reality of a human voice across the light-years, I felt a shift in my own hardened shell. The sheer improbability of it, the defiance of all rational expectation, chipped away at my carefully constructed cynicism. Mac, though still wary, looked equally stunned. We were on a planet orbiting a star trillions of miles away, and someone was broadcasting a welcome message in English, knowing our ship's name. It was either a miracle or something far more complex and unsettling.

When we stepped onto the ground, leaving Larson to his emotional reckoning, a small group of people approached. They were undeniably human, their faces a mix of anticipation and apprehension. The man who had spoken on the radio stepped forward, his expression open and kind.

"Welcome," he said, extending a hand. "We are the descendants of the Odyssey."

He explained that their ship, the Odyssey, had been another deep-space vessel, launched years before the Albert E. They had also experienced unexpected time dilation, arriving at this system long before anticipated. But unlike us, they had found a world already inhabited. Not by aliens, but by another group of humans, the descendants of an even earlier, secret colonization project that had left Earth centuries ago.

These earlier colonists, paranoid and isolationist, had established a technologically advanced but deeply insular society. They possessed the means to monitor interstellar space and had detected both the Odyssey and the Albert E. as they approached. It was they who had broadcast the welcome message, not out of genuine hospitality, but as a test, a lure. They wanted to see if the newcomers were a threat, or if they could be absorbed or controlled.

The Odyssey crew, wary but desperate, had landed and entered into a tense negotiation with the established colony. After years of careful interaction and the slow building of trust, the two groups had merged, forming a new society on "New Columbia." They had learned of Earth's fate through the earlier colonists' historical records and understood the desperation that must have driven our mission.

Their broadcast to us was a gamble, a moment of hope and fear. They welcomed us, genuinely, but with the knowledge that our arrival could disrupt the fragile peace they had built. They spoke our language because they had access to historical linguistic data. They knew our ship's name because their advanced sensors had identified it.

Standing on the surface of New Columbia, under an alien sky, I felt a profound sense of dislocation. My escape from humanity had led me back to it, in a form I could never have predicted. The people of New Columbia were both familiar and strange, carrying the weight of their own long history and the knowledge of Earth's distant past. The cynicism that had defined me for so long felt inadequate in the face of their complex reality. We weren't just explorers; we were the latest wave of a diaspora, arriving at a shore already populated by those who had come before. The future wasn't an empty void to be filled, but a space to be negotiated, shared, and built upon, together. The burden of humanity, it seemed, followed you even to the stars.

Ending 5: The Gardener
Larson's tears and the impossible voice were too much for my jaded sensibilities. While he stumbled down the ramp, I hung back, a knot of suspicion tightening in my gut. Mac, ever the pragmatic one, stayed by my side, his weapon still trained on the seemingly deserted landscape. The spaceship before us looked old, derelict, its hull pocked and scarred. The buildings were overgrown, hinting at years, perhaps decades, of abandonment.

"Something's wrong," I muttered. "This doesn't fit."

Mac nodded, his eyes scanning the surroundings. "Too quiet. Too... perfect in its decay."

We saw movement then, not from the buildings, but from a clearing beyond them. A figure, small and bent, tending to a patch of vibrant, alien flora. They didn't look up as Larson half-ran, half-fell towards the main building.

Dismissing Larson's emotional breakdown, Mac and I moved cautiously towards the figure. As we got closer, we saw it was an old woman, her face a roadmap of wrinkles, her hands gnarled with age and work. She wore simple, homespun clothes. Around her, the plants she tended pulsed with soft, internal light.

She finally looked up as we approached, her eyes ancient and wise. They held no surprise, no fear, only a quiet acceptance. She didn't speak, but a voice echoed in our minds, clear and resonant, bypassing the need for language.

Welcome, travelers. I have been waiting.

We recoiled, startled. It wasn't telepathy as we understood it; it was something deeper, a direct communion of thought.

Who... what are you? I projected, my mind reeling.

I am the Gardener, the thought resonated. This is my garden.

She explained, not in words, but in a cascade of images and feelings, that the planet was not a colony, but a carefully cultivated ecosystem. The spaceship and buildings were remnants of a long-vanished civilization, a species that had mastered interstellar travel and bio-engineering on a cosmic scale. Before they disappeared, they had seeded planets across the galaxy with life, nurturing embryonic ecosystems and leaving behind guardians to tend to their growth.

The Gardener was one such guardian, an ancient being whose life span was measured in millennia. She had observed our approach, not with sensors or radio waves, but with a fundamental understanding of the cosmic currents that guided our ship. The voice we heard, the welcome message, was not a radio broadcast, but a psychic projection, a lure designed to bring us down gently, to assess our nature.

She knew our ship's name, our language, not through technological means, but through a deep, intuitive connection to the patterns of life and thought that emanated from our vessel. Larson's desperate hope, his yearning for connection, had resonated with her, drawing her to communicate in a way we could understand.

The abandoned city was a historical marker, a reminder of the beings who had come before. The "New Columbia" broadcast was a deliberate construct, a facade to appeal to our known desire for colonization and familiarity.

We were not pioneers arriving at a new world, but children stumbling into an ancient, carefully tended garden. The Gardener's purpose was not to colonize or conquer, but to observe, to guide, to ensure the continued flourishing of life she had been entrusted with. Our future lay not in claiming this planet, but in understanding our place within its delicate balance, under the watchful, silent gaze of its timeless caretaker. My cynicism felt small and irrelevant in the face of such profound, patient stewardship. The universe, it turned out, was not just cold and empty, but also held secrets of life and purpose that transcended our limited human understanding.
