**Ending 1: The Empty Vessel**

CHAPTER VII

Mirestone's hand froze, the wine glass suspended halfway to his lips. White. Impossibly, stubbornly white. The feather turned gently on its thread, catching the flickering firelight, showing no trace of the crimson stain that should have been blooming there, sealing Peter Scheinberger's doom.

But Peter *was* doomed. Mirestone had heard the crash, the final, chilling cry from the gorge. The hex *had* worked, hadn't it? The timing was too perfect, the storm too coincidental. The Dutchman's flight and fall were the hex's manifestation, quicker, more violent than anticipated, perhaps, but effective nonetheless. So why the white feather?

A cold dread, different from the thrill of power he'd felt earlier, began to creep up Mirestone's spine. He set the glass down, the clink loud in the sudden silence between thunderclaps. He approached the feather, peering closely. It was the same feather; he recognized a tiny imperfection near the quill. He had held it to Peter's sleeping face, felt the man's breath stir its edges. He had chanted the words, the ancient, potent syllables Peter had reluctantly disgorged.

Could Peter have tricked him? Switched the feather somehow while Mirestone was distracted by the goat, or during the storm's fury? No, impossible. Mirestone had watched him, weary and resigned, finally succumb to sleep. The feather Mirestone had taken was fresh, plucked that day.

Unless... unless the hex required something more? Something Peter hadn't told him? Had the destruction of the body, its plunge into the raging waters below, somehow nullified the final stage? Rendered the symbolic vessel – the feather – inert because the life force it represented was too abruptly, too violently extinguished and dispersed?

Mirestone cursed again, pacing the small cabin. The fool Dutchman! Even in death, he thwarted him. Mirestone needed the proof, the visual confirmation turning the feather red, the slow decay he had anticipated observing. He needed the *process* to study, to refine for his own purposes, for the "glorious reckoning." Now all he had was a dead man, likely dashed to pieces on the rocks, and a pristine white feather mocking him from the rafters.

He snatched the feather down, crumbling it in his fist. Worthless. He still knew the chant, the basic ritual. He had proven it worked on the goat, and, arguably, on Peter himself, albeit messily. It would have to be enough. He could experiment further, refine the technique on lesser enemies first.

He gathered his cloak, the damp wool heavy on his shoulders. He scanned the room one last time – the empty chair where Peter had sat, the hearth's dying glow, the lingering smell of wet earth and fear. He took the last bottle of wine, not bothering to break the neck cleanly this time, smashing it on the stone floor near the door and drinking deeply from the jagged edge, heedless of the cut on his lip.

Stepping out into the receding storm, leaving the door open to the elements, Mirestone didn't look back at the dark cabin or the hidden gorge. He had what he came for, ناقصly perhaps, but he had it. The power was his now. Peter Scheinberger was merely the first, unfortunate casualty in a war only just beginning. The white feather was an anomaly, an irritation, nothing more. He convinced himself of this as he trudged away, the squelching mud sucking at his boots, the first pale hints of dawn painting the ravaged sky. He failed to notice the faint, persistent chill that clung to him, a chill that had nothing to do with the damp night air.

**Ending 2: The Binding Thread**

CHAPTER VII

Mirestone stared, mesmerized. The feather, suspended by the black thread Peter had provided, remained defiantly white. It swung slightly in the drafts that eddied through the rough-hewn cabin, mocking his triumph. Peter was dead; Mirestone had heard the conclusive sounds from the gorge. The hex had claimed him. Yet, the sign, the promised transformation, refused to manifest.

He drained the wine glass, the rough vintage doing little to warm the sudden chill that permeated him. He poured another, his eyes never leaving the feather. Was it possible Peter's desperate act, his self-immolation, had broken the link? Or perhaps... perhaps the hex worked differently on humans? Peter himself had admitted uncertainty: "Maybe not so quick as the goat... dragged on for many days." Could the feather only turn red upon the *natural* conclusion of the hex's slow work, not this violent, premature end?

Frustration warred with a nascent, unformed fear. He needed the proof, the observable result. His plans, his "glorious reckoning," depended on mastering this power, understanding its nuances.

As he watched, transfixed by the stark whiteness against the shadowy rafters, a flicker of color caught his eye. Not on the feather itself, but at the very top, where the black thread looped around the wooden beam. A faint, almost invisible tinge of pink seemed to stain the dark fiber. He blinked, thinking it a trick of the firelight or the wine. He stepped closer, squinting.

It wasn't a trick. A delicate, insidious blush was creeping down the thread, absorbing the blackness, transforming it strand by strand into a vibrant, bloody crimson. It moved slowly, deliberately, like a drop of ink spreading through water. Down, down it crept, along the thread that held the pristine white feather suspended below.

Mirestone recoiled, a gasp escaping his lips. What devilry was this? The hex wasn't tied to the feather changing color, but the *thread*? Peter hadn't mentioned this. Had the old Dutchman held back this crucial detail? Or was this an unforeseen consequence, a perversion of the ritual caused by Peter's suicidal defiance?

He felt a sudden tightness in his own chest, a sharp pain mirroring the goat's last moments. His breath hitched. He looked down at his hands – they seemed pale, veins standing out like cords. The crimson color continued its inexorable descent down the thread, nearing the quill of the still-white feather.

A horrifying realization dawned. The hex hadn't failed. It hadn't been broken. It had been… transferred. Peter's final act, his plunge into the abyss, hadn't saved him, but it had somehow redirected the magical consequence. The thread, the link between the caster and the curse, was now the conduit. And it was leading directly back to *him*.

Panic seized Mirestone. He lunged forward, grabbing a knife from the table, intending to slash the thread, to sever the connection. But as his hand reached out, the crimson finally touched the feather's quill. A jolt, like lightning, shot up his arm, throwing him back against the wall. The white feather instantly began to absorb the color, turning a deep, horrifying red with unnatural speed.

And Mirestone knew. He knew with absolute certainty, as his vision blurred and the cabin walls seemed to close in, that the hex Peter had described – the slow agony, the inevitable end – was now his own. The reckoning had begun, but it was not the one he had planned. He sank to the floor, clutching his chest, his gaze fixed on the blood-red feather swinging gently in the firelight, a symbol not of his power, but of his inescapable doom.

**Ending 3: The Lingering Stain**

CHAPTER VII

White. The feather remained stubbornly, accusingly white. Mirestone lowered the wine glass, a frown creasing his pallid brow. Peter was gone, swallowed by the storm and the gorge. The hex should have completed its visible cycle. Why hadn't it?

He crossed the room, his boots echoing on the rough floorboards. He reached up and touched the feather gently. It felt ordinary, soft and yielding. No trace of the sinister transformation he expected. Had Peter's violent death somehow... cleansed it? Broken the sympathetic link before the final sign could manifest?

It was infuriating. The Dutchman had cheated him, denying him the full observation, the complete understanding he craved for his future endeavors. Still, the primary goal was achieved. The hex worked on humans – Peter's demise was proof enough, however abrupt. He, Martin Mirestone, now possessed the knowledge.

He decided to leave. This place, thick with the psychic residue of fear and death, suddenly felt oppressive. He pulled his cloak tighter, grabbed the last wine bottle, and headed for the door. As he drew the bolt, his hand brushed against the rough wood. He paused. Something felt… sticky.

He looked down. On his fingertips, where they had touched the door, was a smear of faint, pinkish-red. Strange. He hadn't cut himself. Wiping his hand on his cloak, he dismissed it. Perhaps some residue from the goat, or rust mixed with rainwater.

He stepped out into the stormy dawn. The rain had lessened, but mist still coiled thickly from the gorge, obscuring the mangled bridge. He started down the path, eager to put distance between himself and the Scheinberger farm. Yet, as he walked, he felt an odd sensation, a slight dampness spreading on his back where the cloak touched him. He reached behind, his fingers probing the heavy wool. They came away stained again, this time a deeper, more definite red.

Unease prickled him. He stopped, shrugging off the cloak. Holding it up in the grey light, he saw it – faint, reddish stains blooming across the dark fabric, like patches of damp mildew, centered roughly where his back had been. Where had they come from?

He looked back towards the cabin. The doorway was a dark rectangle in the gloom. And hanging just inside, visible even from this distance, was the feather. Still white.

Or was it? As he stared, a trick of the light, or perhaps his straining eyes, made it seem as if the feather pulsed with a faint, internal luminescence, a barely perceptible rosy hue that wasn't quite *on* the feather, but *within* it.

Mirestone shook his head, cursing his imagination. It was the wine, the lack of sleep, the storm's oppressive atmosphere. Yet, he couldn't shake the feeling of contamination. He dropped the cloak, leaving it lying in the mud. He wiped his hands vigorously on his trousers, but the faint reddish tinge seemed to remain, ingrained in his skin.

He hurried away, almost running now, away from the cabin, away from the gorge, away from the mocking white feather. He told himself he was free, powerful, victorious. But a nagging suspicion lingered, cold and sharp as a shard of ice: Peter was dead, the hex concluded, but perhaps the stain of such magic, once invoked, could not be so easily contained. Perhaps it lingered, seeking a new host, bleeding out into the world in ways the old books never described. The white feather remained pure, but Mirestone felt inexplicably, permanently tainted.

**Ending 4: The Land Remembers**

CHAPTER VII

The feather hung motionless, its whiteness absolute, almost luminous against the dark, smoke-stained rafters. Mirestone frowned, swirling the wine in his glass. Peter's death cry still echoed in his memory, carried on the wind from the gorge. The hex had undoubtedly worked, fulfilled its lethal purpose. So why did the feather refuse its final transformation?

He considered the possibilities. Had Peter lied about this detail? Was the color change merely folklore, a later embellishment to the core ritual? Or did the violent interruption of the process negate this final sign? He felt cheated of the complete spectacle, the full confirmation of his newfound power.

He approached the feather, intending to take it down, a useless relic now. As his fin-gers neared it, a low groan seemed to emanate not from the storm outside, but from the very foundations of the cabin. The floorboards vibrated slightly beneath his feet. The fire in the hearth suddenly flared, casting exaggerated, dancing shadows.

Mirestone froze, hand outstretched. The air grew heavy, thick with an ancient, palpable presence. It wasn't Peter's ghost; it was something older, deeper – the accumulated weight of generations who had lived and died on this land, steeped in the _hexerei_ Peter had both feared and, ultimately, embodied.

He remembered Peter's reluctance, his talk of tradition, of things best left undisturbed. He had scoffed then, dismissing it as peasant superstition. Now, surrounded by the groaning timbers and the watchful silence of the hills outside, he felt a prickle of doubt, of primal fear.

He forced himself to reach for the feather again. As his fingertips brushed the soft barbs, a sharp crack echoed through the cabin. He snatched his hand back as if burned. A thin fissure had appeared on the stone mantelpiece above the fire, splitting it cleanly in two.

The message was clear. The land itself, the very spirit of this place bound by generations of belief and practice, rejected him. It had allowed the hex to run its course on one of its own – Peter, who belonged here – but it would not yield its secrets or sanction their profane use by an outsider, an arrogant intruder seeking power for vengeance. The white feather was a symbol not of failure, but of defiance. It remained pure because his tainted hands could not truly grasp the power it represented here, on this protected ground.

Mirestone backed away, his confidence evaporating like mist in the sun. He felt suddenly weak, exposed. His knowledge seemed hollow, useless against this elemental resistance. He grabbed his cloak, not daring to touch anything else, a desperate need to escape consuming him.

He fled the cabin, stumbling out into the storm-lashed dawn. He didn't look back at the small, dark house, hunkered defensively against the hillside. He knew, with a certainty that chilled him more than the rain, that the power he sought was real, but that he could not wield it here. Peter Scheinberger, in his final, desperate act, hadn't just killed himself; he had returned the hex to the land that spawned it, locking it away from Mirestone's grasp. He had the knowledge, yes, but stripped of its context, its roots, it was a dangerous, perhaps even fatal, thing. The white feather remained, a silent guardian, a testament to power Mirestone could glimpse but never truly hold.

**Ending 5: The Unraveling Mind**

CHAPTER VII

White. Stark, unrelenting white. Mirestone blinked, shaking his head as if to clear it. The wine, the lack of sleep, the storm's cacophony – they were playing tricks on his eyes. It *had* to be red. Peter was dead, his scream swallowed by the gorge. The hex was complete.

He drained his glass and poured another, his hand trembling slightly. He stared intently at the feather, willing it to change. Was that a faint pinkish tinge at the quill's base? He leaned closer, eyes narrowed. No, gone. Just the firelight reflecting unevenly.

A clap of thunder rattled the shutters, making him jump. In the momentary silence that followed, he thought he heard a faint sound from outside – the nicker of a horse. Impossible. Peter and his horse were shattered remnants at the bottom of the ravine.

He laughed, a harsh, unsteady sound. "Getting spooked, Mirestone?" he muttered to himself. "Letting the peasant's superstitions get to you?"

He focused again on the feather. White. Mockingly white. Perhaps Peter's final, defiant act had somehow... tainted the magic? Or maybe the old Dutchman had subtly altered the chant, introducing a flaw Mirestone hadn't caught? The uncertainty gnawed at him. His grand plans, his vengeance, seemed suddenly built on shaky ground if he couldn't even trust the results of this first, crucial test.

Lightning flashed, illuminating the rain-lashed windowpane. For a fleeting instant, Mirestone saw a face reflected there – Peter's face, pale and accusing, water streaming down his furrowed cheeks. Mirestone cried out, stumbling back, splashing wine down his front. He spun around, heart pounding. Nothing. Just the empty cabin, the dying fire, the incessant drumming of the rain.

He was losing control. The strain, the violence, the weight of what he had done, were fracturing his composure. He looked back at the feather. It *seemed* white, yes, but was it? Could he trust his own senses anymore?

He lurched towards it, needing to touch it, to verify its reality. As he reached up, the feather seemed to quiver, to ripple. He snatched his hand back. Did it just... whisper? Did it breathe Peter's name on a sighing draft?

"No!" he shouted, his voice cracking. "It worked! He's dead! The feather *should* be red!"

He grabbed the remaining wine bottle, smashing the neck carelessly and gulping down the raw spirit. It burned his throat but did little to quell the rising panic, the growing conviction that something was terribly wrong. He sank into Peter's chair, shivering despite the fire's heat, his eyes darting between the accusing white feather and the dark, rain-blurred window where he kept imagining Peter's spectral face.

The storm raged on, mirroring the tempest in his mind. He was trapped in the dead man's cabin, haunted by doubt and hallucination, the pristine white feather a constant, maddening symbol of his potentially flawed victory, or perhaps, of his own unraveling sanity. The glorious reckoning seemed very far away now, lost in the howling wind and the terrifying whiteness of a single, unblemished feather. He began to sob, dry, racking sobs, alone in the dark heart of the _hexerei_.
