**Ending 1: The Fire**

CHAPTER III

My new life was different. The people were kind enough, in their way, but it wasn’t home. There were no Sunday-school lessons filtering into the drawing-room, no gatherings of neighborhood dogs where big words could be practiced and admired or misunderstood. There was comfort, yes, and regular meals, but a persistent ache remained where my mother and siblings used to be. I carried her last words with me, though, tucked away more carefully than any Synonymous or Unintellectual she’d ever paraded. "In memory of me, when there is a time of danger to another do not think of yourself, think of your mother, and do as she would do."

The danger came not in the form of a snarling stranger or a runaway wagon, but as a creeping, insidious thing. It started as a peculiar smell, sharp and acrid, tickling my nose while the house slept. Then, a thin curl of smoke slithered under the nursery door. Inside, the master’s youngest child, a small creature barely steady on its legs, coughed in its sleep.

Fear, cold and immediate, gripped me. My instinct screamed to bolt, to find an open window, to save myself. The memory of my mother’s bravery, however, pushed back. Not her showy education, not the complicated phrases she mangled, but the quiet, steady courage she possessed when it truly mattered – the way she’d faced down a charging bull once to protect us pups, standing firm until it veered away. What would *she* do?

She wouldn’t hesitate. She wouldn’t run. She would protect the helpless.

I scrambled to the nursery door, barking furiously, throwing myself against the wood. Smoke stung my eyes, filled my lungs. The child began to cry, a thin, terrified wail. I barked louder, a frantic, desperate alarm, remembering the tone the humans used when something was gravely wrong.

Finally, footsteps pounded on the stairs. The master burst through the door, recoiling from the heat and smoke. He snatched the crying child, his face pale with terror. He didn’t notice me then, lost in the haze and panic. As the family stumbled out into the cold night air, coughing and weeping, I limped behind them, my fur singed, my throat raw.

Later, when the flames were subdued and the immediate danger passed, the master knelt beside me. He stroked my head, his hand trembling. “You saved her,” he murmured, his voice thick. “Brave girl. You saved her.”

There was no grand reward, no heavenly hereafter as my mother had heard spoken of for men. But as I lay there, catching my breath, I felt a warmth spread through me that had nothing to do with the smoldering house. It was the feeling my mother had described – a worthiness, a dignity. In that moment of peril, I hadn't thought of myself. I had thought of my mother, and I had done as she would do. I couldn't see her, couldn't touch her, but I had kept my promise. And though my heart still ached with missing her, it also swelled with a quiet pride. I finally understood the best part of her legacy, the part that wasn't just fine large words, but deeds. And that, I thought, was a reward in itself, solid and real, something even a dictionary couldn't define away.

**Ending 2: The Scientist's Price**

CHAPTER III

My path took a turn I could never have foreseen. I was sold again, not to a family, but to a place of strange smells and cold surfaces – the laboratory of a man they called a scientist. He was not unkind in his manner, but his eyes held a detached curiosity that chilled me more than any harsh word. Here, there were other animals, confined in cages, their eyes holding a fear I began to understand all too well.

My mother's lessons seemed distant in this sterile world. Her talk of duty, of doing right without reward, echoed strangely against the backdrop of scientific 'purpose'. The men here spoke of progress, of understanding life, yet often seemed indifferent to the lives they held captive. There was one small terrier, frail and quiet, who bore the brunt of many experiments. His whimpers were a constant, mournful sound in the otherwise quiet building.

I remembered my mother facing down bigger dogs, her courage unwavering. I remembered her final words: "...when there is a time of danger to another do not think of yourself, think of your mother, and do as she would do." Was this terrier not in danger? A slow, creeping danger, perhaps, but danger nonetheless.

What would my mother do? She, who couldn't abide seeing another creature suffer, even if her understanding of grand concepts was flawed? She would not stand by. Her kindness, her essential goodness, would compel her to act.

My opportunity came during a moment of carelessness. An attendant, carrying the terrier back from some procedure, was distracted by a sudden commotion elsewhere in the lab. He placed the cage on the floor near my own enclosure, the latch not fully secured, and hurried off. The terrier lay inside, trembling, barely moving.

My heart pounded. This was my chance. Thinking of my mother's bravery, her promptness in time of peril, I nudged my own enclosure's latch – a trick I’d learned through careful observation. Slipping out quietly, I went to the terrier's cage. Using my nose, I pushed the unsecured latch open.

The terrier looked at me, confused, then slowly, painfully, crawled out. He was weak, disoriented. I nudged him gently towards a dark corner beneath a low shelf, a place I’d noted previously, hoping he might find temporary refuge there. He huddled into the shadows, disappearing from easy view.

Just then, the attendant returned. Seeing the empty cage, he swore under his breath. His eyes swept the room, landing on me, sitting quietly back near my own enclosure, trying to look as innocent as my mother must have looked after deploying 'Synonymous'. He eyed me suspiciously but, seeing no direct evidence, simply secured my latch firmly and went searching for the terrier.

I don’t know if the terrier escaped the lab entirely, or if his respite was merely brief. But in that moment, acting not for reward, nor for praise, but simply because it felt like the right thing – the thing my mother would have done – I felt a connection to her profound and true. The scientist sought knowledge by taking things apart; my mother taught wisdom through simple, unwavering kindness. Her education, the one that truly mattered, lived on in me. It was a quiet act, unseen by most, but it filled my small life with a dignity the cold instruments and searching eyes of this place could never comprehend, nor take away. And I knew, had she seen it, my mother would have been proud, not of fancy words, but of the deed itself.

**Ending 3: The River**

CHAPTER III

Life took me to a place beside a wide, swift river. My new family lived in a small house perched near its banks, and the water was a constant presence – its murmur a lullaby on calm nights, its roar a threat during the spring thaws. I learned its moods, its power. My mother had taught us to face peril, and here, peril felt very close whenever the rains came hard and the river swelled.

One spring, the rains were relentless. Day after day, the water rose, creeping higher up the banks, swirling with debris. Anxious murmurs filled the house. Then, one afternoon, a section of the bank upstream gave way with a mighty groan. A torrent surged, widening the river, turning it into a brown, churning beast.

Panic erupted. People scrambled for higher ground. Our house was precarious, but still holding. Amidst the chaos, I heard a thin, desperate cry. Down near the water’s edge, clinging to the branches of a half-submerged willow tree, was the neighbor’s cat – a creature I’d had many territorial disputes with, a fluffy annoyance I generally avoided. But now, it was small, terrified, its claws slipping on the wet bark as the current tugged relentlessly at the branches.

My first instinct, I confess, was a flicker of satisfaction. Served the creature right for stealing my sunny spot on the porch. But then, my mother’s last words echoed, clear as if she were standing beside me: "In memory of me, when there is a time of danger to another do not think of yourself, think of your mother, and do as she would do."

Danger? This was certainly danger. Another? The cat, despite our differences, was undeniably another creature in peril. Think of my mother... what would she do? She, who harbored no resentments, who put injuries easily out of her mind? She wouldn't care that it was *that* cat. She would see only a creature in need.

Hesitation vanished. I plunged into the cold, swirling water. The current was strong, pulling at me, logs and branches bumping against my sides. I fought my way towards the willow, barking encouragement – or what I hoped sounded like it – to the terrified cat. Reaching the tree, I nudged the cat, trying to guide it towards a thicker branch, one less likely to break. It hissed, claws extended, too frightened to understand.

The water surged again, tearing the willow's roots further. The branch the cat clung to dipped dangerously low. Thinking only of my mother's resolve, I positioned myself beneath the cat, trying to offer my back as a temporary purchase, a bridge to a sturdier part of the tree. The cat, perhaps sensing the futility of its own perch, scrambled onto my back, digging its claws in for balance.

Burdened, struggling against the relentless current, I tried to swim back towards the receding shoreline. The water was colder now, my limbs heavy. Each stroke was an agony. I could hear shouting from the bank, but it sounded far away. I could feel the cat trembling on my back. I just needed to get a little closer...

I don't know if we made it. My last sensation was the icy grip of the river, the roar of the water filling my ears, and a profound sense of peace. I had faced the peril. I had thought of another. I had, I hoped, done as my mother would do. Perhaps her Sunday-school tales of reward were just words, like ‘supererogation’. But the dignity she spoke of, the worthiness earned by doing right without thought of reward – that felt real, even as the dark water closed over me.

**Ending 4: The Legacy Whispered**

CHAPTER III

Years passed in my new home. It was a quiet life, mostly. I grew older, my muzzle frosted with grey, my bursts of playful energy replaced by long naps in sunbeams. The sharp pang of separation from my mother softened into a gentle ache, a constant companion rather than a raw wound. Her final words, however, never faded. They became less a command and more a lens through which I viewed the small world around me.

There was no single, grand moment of danger like the ones my mother faced or perhaps imagined. Instead, there were countless small opportunities. There was the time the baker’s boy dropped his basket, scattering rolls in the dusty street, and I helped gather them, gently carrying them back instead of snatching one for myself – remembering my mother teaching us restraint. There was the new pup in the neighborhood, shy and easily bullied, whom I took under my protection, shielding him from the rougher dogs, just as my mother had shielded us – remembering her gentle ways. There was the master’s wife, weeping quietly on the porch swing one afternoon, and I rested my head on her knee, offering silent comfort – remembering my mother’s kind heart.

These were not deeds worthy of song or story. They were small, everyday acts, prompted by that lingering instruction: "...do not think of yourself, think of your mother, and do as she would do." I often reflected on her complex character – the vanity and the virtue, the showy words and the solid actions. It occurred to me that perhaps her true "education" wasn't in the long words she borrowed, but in the simple truths she lived by when it counted. The bravery, the kindness, the selflessness – these were the lessons she truly mastered, and the ones she passed on not through sermons, but through example.

Sometimes, watching the children in my new family squabble and then forgive, or seeing the master perform an unexpected act of generosity, I thought about the "wise and good purpose" my mother believed we were all sent here for. I still didn't understand the human notions of reward or other worlds she’d picked up at Sunday-school. But I came to believe that the purpose, for a dog at least, might be simpler: to live with kindness, to offer loyalty, and to be brave when needed, not for a reward, but because it lent our brief lives that "worthiness and dignity" she spoke of.

As I lay in my favorite spot, watching the twilight settle, I felt a quiet contentment. I had not achieved fame or status, like my mother perhaps desired in her own frivolous way. But I had carried her best part with me. Her final lesson, the one whispered through tears, had shaped my days. I hadn't forgotten. And in my own quiet way, day by day, I had done as she would do. Perhaps that was the most lasting memory, the truest monument one could build.

**Ending 5: The Misinterpreted Peril**

CHAPTER III

My new surroundings were pleasant enough, though lacking the intellectual stimulation – or perhaps I should say, the vocabulary – I had grown accustomed to. There were other dogs, of course, but none possessed my mother’s flair for the dramatic pronouncement or her arsenal of perplexing terminology. Still, her final admonition stayed with me, sharp and clear: "In memory of me, when there is a time of danger to another do not think of yourself, think of your mother, and do as she would do." I was vigilant, waiting for my moment to prove worthy.

The 'danger' arrived in a most unexpected, and frankly, undignified form. It involved Mrs. Higgins' prize-winning Persian cat, Snowdrift, and a wheelbarrow full of particularly pungent fish fertilizer. Snowdrift, a creature of profound arrogance and limited wisdom, had decided the wheelbarrow offered a superior vantage point from which to survey her domain. Unfortunately, the wheelbarrow was perched precariously on the edge of a small incline leading down to the garden pond.

I observed this tableau with growing unease. The cat seemed oblivious, preening itself with infuriating calm. The wheelbarrow teetered slightly. Surely, this constituted peril! A fall, immersion in stagnant water, contact with odoriferous substances – a catastrophe for such a delicate being! What would my mother do?

Recalling her dramatic interventions (often based, I suspected, on misunderstandings of overheard human conversations), I knew decisive action was required. She wouldn't just bark; she would act with authority and perhaps a touch of baffling vocabulary, if any came to mind.

"Desist!" I barked, charging towards the scene. "Impending calamity necessitates immediate evacuation! Synonymous with… with grave aquatic consequences!" The words felt right, echoing my mother's emergency preparedness.

Snowdrift merely blinked, startled by my sudden appearance. The other dogs nearby, a lumbering Newfoundland and a skittish terrier, looked utterly bewildered. My charge, however, had unforeseen repercussions. My momentum carried me past the cat and directly into the handles of the wheelbarrow.

The result was instantaneous and disastrous. The wheelbarrow tipped, inertia took hold, and it rumbled down the slope. Snowdrift, letting out an indignant yowl, leaped clear at the last second, landing safely, if ungracefully, on the grass. The wheelbarrow, however, completed its journey with a magnificent splash, depositing its fragrant cargo into the pond.

I stood panting, watching the fertilizer spread like a vile slick. The other dogs stared. Snowdrift stalked away, tail twitching furiously. Mrs. Higgins appeared at her window, uttering sounds of distinct displeasure.

In the aftermath, amidst the lingering aroma and Mrs. Higgins' pointed glares, I felt a peculiar mix of emotions. I had acted! I had faced danger (or what I perceived as such)! I had attempted to help another! True, the outcome was not precisely heroic. The cat had saved itself, and I had merely succeeded in polluting the pond and incurring human wrath. Yet, hadn't I followed the spirit of my mother's command? I hadn’t thought of myself (indeed, the consequences were rather unpleasant for me). I had acted decisively in the face of perceived peril.

Perhaps, like my mother with her anecdotes, I had gotten the nub of one situation hitched onto another where it didn't quite fit. Still, as I retreated to a less pungent corner of the yard, I couldn't help but feel a certain satisfaction. I had done *something*. It felt important, somehow. Maybe true bravery, like my mother's grasp of vocabulary, wasn't always about perfect execution, but about the willingness to try, however flawed the attempt. And in that, I felt I truly was my mother’s daughter.
