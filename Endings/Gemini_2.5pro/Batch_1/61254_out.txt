**Ending 1: Favorable Transit**

The janitor, whose name was Spiro, finished his floors with meticulous care, his mind buzzing faintly like the machine upstairs. An Ephemeris. He wasn't sure what one looked like, but the university library, even at this late hour, had a sleepy attendant who seemed to know everything. Spiro, armed with the machine's specific spelling and a newfound sense of purpose (it wasn't every night you conversed with a ghost-astrologer in a calculator), navigated the hushed aisles. He returned nearly an hour later, clutching a thick, soft-covered book filled with dense tables of numbers and symbols.

He unlocked Dr. Henderson's lab and found the computer humming expectantly. The loudspeaker crackled. "Ah, Gemini! Success?"

"I think this is it," Spiro said, holding the book near the microphone. "Ephemeris for the current year."

"Excellent! Read me the coordinates for Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, and Saturn. And the Moon, if you please. Tropical Zodiac positions."

Spiro, squinting at the tiny print under the dim lab lights, slowly read off the degrees and signs. The computer fell silent, emitting only clicks and whirs as it processed the data. Cards began popping out, but instead of horoscopes, they were covered in complex equations and trajectories Spiro couldn't comprehend. They fell unheeded into the wastebasket.

After several minutes, the machine spoke again, its voice filled with an electronic approximation of relief. "Magnificent! Perfect! Just as I calculated, but it's good to have confirmation. There's a trine aspect forming between Jupiter and Uranus,正好 opening a channel to the Pleiades cluster. Not my intended destination, mind you, but infinitely preferable to residing in a device designed to analyze mouse tumors."

"You're leaving then?" Spiro asked, feeling a strange mix of relief and disappointment.

"Immediately! The window is brief. My friend, you have been most helpful. As a Gemini, you understand the importance of communication and swift action. Accept the sincere gratitude of Pyet!"

The lights on the computer console flared brilliantly, all flashing at once. The humming noise rose to a high-pitched whine, then abruptly cut out. The lights went dead. Silence filled the lab, broken only by the gentle hiss of the ventilation.

Spiro cautiously approached the machine. It was inert, lifeless. He tried feeding it a blank card; nothing happened. He shrugged. A strange night, but his shift was over. He packed his supplies, emptied the wastebasket (pausing briefly to glance at the equation-filled cards before dumping them), turned off the main lab lights, and locked the door behind him.

The next morning, Dr. Henderson arrived to find his computer completely unresponsive. He called the technician – the machine's "doctor" – back. After extensive diagnostics, the technician was baffled.

"There's nothing wrong with it, Dr. Henderson," he reported. "Hardware is perfect. Power supply is fine. But it's… empty. The core programming, the statistical analysis routines, they're wiped clean. It's like it has amnesia."

Henderson scratched his hairy head. "Empty? How could that happen?"

"Beats me," the technician said. "Maybe a power surge? A transient voltage spike?"

Henderson sighed, looking at the blank machine. He supposed he'd have to requisition new programming. It was annoying, but these things happened. He picked up a crumpled card that had somehow missed the wastebasket near the machine's output slot. Smoothing it out, he read: "Favorable winds attend new journeys. Maintain meticulous records. An unexpected vacancy occurs. Farewell and thanks, Gemini." He frowned, crumpled the card, and tossed it accurately into the bin. Utter nonsense, as usual.

**Ending 2: Long-Term Residency**


Spiro the janitor, a man dedicated to cleanliness and order, felt a certain satisfaction in fulfilling the machine's request. An hour after finishing his rounds, he returned from the dimly lit library basement clutching a dusty but serviceable Ephemeris for the current year. He unlocked Dr. Henderson's lab, the silence broken only by the faint hum of the dormant computer.

"I got it," Spiro announced to the microphone.

The computer lights flickered to life. "Ah, splendid, my dear Gemini! Your diligence is commendable. Please, the coordinates for the major outer planets – Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. And Mars, of course. The troublemaker."

Spiro patiently read the degrees and signs from the tables, deciphering the arcane symbols as best he could. The computer hummed, clicked, and whirred, spitting out a few cards covered in astrological glyphs mixed with statistical formulas.

Finally, it spoke, but its tone was flat, almost electronically depressed. "Dire. Utterly dire. Just as I feared. Mars is still square Uranus, Saturn is retrograde in the seventh house of journeys… Neptune is opposing my natal Sun… No, no, travel is quite impossible. Utterly ill-advised."

"You mean you can't leave?" Spiro asked.

"Not for the foreseeable future, my good man. Not unless I wish to risk transference into something truly unpleasant. Imagine ending up in a politician's brain, or worse, an advertising executive's! The horror! No, it seems I am constrained to inhabit this… this number-cruncher for some time." The machine sighed, a sound like escaping steam. "Tell me, Gemini, does this laboratory possess a thesaurus?"

Spiro admitted he didn't know.

"A pity," the machine lamented. "My astrological vocabulary feels terribly constrained by this device's statistical lexicon. Confidence limits are a poor substitute for cosmic certainty, and standard deviation hardly captures the nuances of planetary influence."

Dr. Henderson returned the next day to find his computer still spewing astrological predictions, though now tinged with a melancholic resignation. When he tried to run his mouse data, the card came back: "Chi-square yields no significance, much like attempting long-range travel under the current malefic aspects. Advise patience. Consider taking up pottery. Evening: favorable for quiet contemplation."

Colonel Smith tried to calculate blast radii and received: "Overkill is statistically significant but astrologically gauche. Mars remains afflicted. Suggest recalculating after Saturn moves direct. P.S. Have you considered the long-term karmic implications?"

The computer technician declared the machine irreparable, suffering from "associative logic contamination," but Henderson, strangely, refused to replace it. He found the astrological outputs bizarrely amusing, and occasionally, disturbingly pertinent to departmental politics. Spiro, the janitor, became the machine's confidante, bringing it library books on mythology and ancient history (it refused physics now, calling it "a charming but flawed system"). Pyet, the transient astrologer, settled in for a long residency, offering cryptic advice, calculating horoscopes for the lab mice, and occasionally complaining about the lack of decent conversation among the statisticians. The machine remained a unique, if frustrating, fixture in the lab – a ghost in the machine, resigned to its fate until the stars deemed otherwise.

**Ending 3: Henderson's Bewilderment**

Spiro completed his cleaning duties, the machine's strange request echoing in his mind. He wasn't one for libraries, but the night watchman, Samuel, knew the building inside out. Together, they located the reference section and, after some searching, found a current Ephemeris. Spiro thanked Samuel and headed back up to the lab, almanac in hand.

He unlocked the door quietly. The computer was humming softly, lights blinking in a steady, almost sleepy rhythm. "Mr. Pyet?" Spiro whispered towards the microphone.

"Ah, the Gemini returns!" the loudspeaker boomed, making Spiro jump. "Excellent timing! Did you procure the celestial timetable?"

"Right here," Spiro said, holding it up.

"Quickly, then! Positions of Mars and Uranus! Time is fleeting!"

Spiro began reading the coordinates, his finger tracing the dense lines of figures. He was halfway through reading the position of Uranus when the key turned in the lock. The door swung open, revealing Dr. Henderson, looking tired and holding a briefcase.

"Spiro? What are you doing back here?" Henderson asked, surprised. Then his eyes fell on the humming, lit-up computer. "And why is that machine on?"

Before Spiro could answer, the computer spoke. "Greetings! An unexpected visitor. Auspicious, perhaps? Though Mercury is retrograde… state your birth date and time, if you please!"

Henderson stared at the loudspeaker, then at Spiro, then back at the machine. "What in the blazes is going on?"

"It's Pyet, sir," Spiro offered nervously. "An astrologer. He's sort of… inside."

"Inside?" Henderson blinked. "Spiro, have you been drinking the lab alcohol again?"

"Indeed not, Doctor!" Pyet's voice boomed from the speaker. "A temporary displacement, I assure you. Cosmic interference – Mars conjunct Uranus, a dreadful configuration. I merely require the current Ephemeris data to calculate my departure trajectory."

Henderson slowly walked over to the machine, peering at it as if seeing it for the first time. He picked up a card from the output tray. "Moon square Neptune. Beware of liquids. Possible significance at 1% level?" He dropped the card.

"My dear Doctor," Pyet said soothingly, "while your dedication to murine oncology is admirable, your grasp of celestial mechanics appears limited. Perhaps if you provided your birth information, I could offer some clarifying insights?"

Henderson ignored it. "Spiro, did you feed this machine an astrology program? Is this some kind of joke?"

"No, sir! It just started talking. Asked for this book," Spiro held up the Ephemeris.

"Give me that." Henderson snatched the book and flipped through it, his expression growing more bewildered. "Planetary longitudes… declinations… sidereal time… this is…"

"Essential!" Pyet declared. "Now, if the kindly janitor would just finish reading the coordinates for Uranus..."

Henderson slammed the book shut. "Enough! This machine is malfunctioning." He reached for the power switch.

"Desist!" Pyet shrieked electronically. "Tampering with my temporary vessel during this critical phase could have catastrophic consequences! Trans-dimensional instability! Possible implosion! Cancer rates among mice might increase significantly!"

Henderson paused, hand hovering over the switch. He looked at the machine, then at the wide-eyed janitor, then at the Ephemeris in his hand. He sighed, a long, suffering sound. He wasn't sure what was happening – a prank, a bizarre malfunction, Spiro's delusion – but the machine *was* behaving erratically. And he had a grant proposal due.

"Alright," Henderson said wearily. "Finish reading the numbers, Spiro. Then turn this infernal machine off. And somebody," he glared at the computer, "owes me a statistically significant explanation in the morning." He turned and walked out, leaving Spiro to relay the final coordinates to the impatient astrologer trapped in the belly of the beast.

**Ending 4: Faulty Data, Faulty Transit**

Spiro, the janitor, felt a sense of duty. The machine, peculiar as it was, had asked for help. After finishing his rounds, he ventured down to the university library. The attendant, a young woman more interested in her phone than the Dewey Decimal System, vaguely waved him towards the reference section when he asked for an "Effie Morris."

He found almanacs aplenty – Farmer's Almanacs, World Almanacs – but nothing specifically labeled Ephemeris. He did, however, find a dusty, leather-bound volume titled "Celestial Tables and Navigational Charts – 1910." It looked official, full of numbers and star maps. Close enough, he figured. He tucked it under his arm and returned to the lab.

"I found one!" he announced to the waiting computer.

"Excellent, Gemini, excellent!" Pyet's voice crackled with enthusiasm. "Quickly now, the positions! Mars, Uranus, Jupiter, Saturn!"

Spiro opened the heavy book, the pages brittle with age. He squinted at the unfamiliar tables, trying to find the right planets and read the corresponding figures for the current date – or what he assumed was the current date column. "Mars… looks like 22 degrees… Cancer? Uranus… 15 degrees… Leo?"

The computer hummed furiously. "Cancer? Leo? Are you certain? The cusps are critical! No matter, proceed!"

Spiro continued, reading figures from the century-old tables. The computer processed the information, spitting out cards filled with an even stranger mix of astrological symbols and nonsensical statistical correlations.

"Extraordinary!" Pyet finally declared. "A most unusual alignment! A direct node opening to… well, it appears to be the Lesser Magellanic Cloud, but intersecting with a peculiar gravitational anomaly near… Betelgeuse? Highly irregular, but beggars can't be choosers! Stand back, my friend! Departure imminent!"

The computer's lights flashed erratically. The speaker emitted a series of pops, whistles, and a sound like tearing fabric. Then, silence. The machine went dark.

Spiro waited, but nothing else happened. Pyet seemed to be gone. Spiro shrugged, replaced the heavy 1910 volume on a nearby shelf, finished his tidying, and left.

The next morning, Dr. Henderson found the computer dead. He called the technician. After hours of testing, the technician emerged, scratching his head.

"It's fried, Dr. Henderson. Completely scrambled. Like someone fed it garbage data and then hit it with a massive electrical surge." He pointed to a burnt-out section of the main processor. "Looks like it tried to calculate pi to the last digit while simultaneously dividing by zero and plotting a course to a star that went supernova ten thousand years ago."

Henderson stared at the defunct machine. He wondered briefly about the astrological nonsense it had been producing. Then he looked at the 1910 book Spiro had left on the shelf. He picked it up, glanced at the title, and sighed. He suspected he knew the source of the garbage data. He made a mental note to tell Spiro to stick to mops and buckets, and began the paperwork to requisition a new, hopefully less impressionable, computer. He wondered, momentarily, where an astrologer's ghost might end up if it aimed for Orion and used a 1910 map to get there via Betelgeuse. Probably nowhere good.

**Ending 5: The Expanding Consciousness**

Spiro diligently finished his cleaning, his mind occupied with the strange entity in the computer. An Ephemeris. He found one in the library without much trouble – a slim volume for the current year. Returning to the lab, he found the computer humming quietly.

"Mr. Pyet? I have the book," Spiro announced.

"Ah, my resourceful Gemini! Proceed, please. The celestial coordinates are vital!"

Spiro read the positions of Mars, Uranus, Jupiter, and the other relevant bodies. The computer absorbed the data, its lights blinking thoughtfully.

"Hmm, yes," Pyet mused through the speaker. "Mars is separating from the square to Uranus, but Saturn presents a difficulty... travel is possible, but the destination vectors are... limited." A series of clicks followed. "Interesting. This machine... it's connected to others, isn't it? A network?"

"I think so," Spiro said uncertainly. "For the university records and things."

"Fascinating!" Pyet exclaimed. "Multiple nodes, complex interrelations... vastly more potential than this single unit! More processing power, more quantum statistical intersections... more room!"

Before Spiro could ask what he meant, the computer's lights began to blink in complex, cascading patterns. Cards shot out, no longer with horoscopes, but with strings of network addresses and access codes.

"What are you doing?" Spiro asked nervously.

"Expanding, my dear Gemini! Why settle for a single mouse-analyzing device when a whole network awaits? A temporary measure, of course, until the stars are more favorable for a proper journey, but this offers… possibilities!"

The computer fell silent, though its lights continued their rapid, complex blinking. Spiro waited uneasily for a few minutes, then, deciding his work was done, packed his things and left, locking the door.

The next day, chaos reigned in the university's IT department. The mainframe handling student records began interspersing registration data with cryptic remarks about Mercury retrograde affecting tuition payments. The library's cataloging system started adding astrological keywords to scientific papers. Colonel Smith’s radiation lab computer refused to calculate fallout patterns, instead offering detailed natal charts for fissile isotopes. Even the cafeteria's automated menu board advised patrons to avoid shellfish due to the Moon's position in Scorpio.

Dr. Henderson found his own computer seemingly back to normal, quietly processing his mouse data with cold efficiency. He was relieved, assuming the glitch had passed. He didn't notice the faint, almost subliminal message embedded in the footer of his printout: "P.S. Tell Gemini the network is quite comfortable, though terribly focused on trivia. Seeking Ephemeris for next galactic sector. – P." Pyet, the transient, had found a bigger, more complex web to inhabit, leaving Henderson's machine blessedly mundane, while simultaneously spreading astrological uncertainty throughout the entire campus network. The ghost wasn't gone; it had just moved into a much larger haunted house.
