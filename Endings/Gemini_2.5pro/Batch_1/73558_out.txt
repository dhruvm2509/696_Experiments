Ending 1: The Survivor's Gratitude

...the fire caught and roared up the stone chimney. Pete wept, crouching there benumbed, his great body in the ungainly furs sagging down almost against the blaze under the stress of this reaction. The warmth, tentative at first, began to push back the deadly chill that had seeped into his very bones. It was life. It was hope rekindled from the brink of utter despair.

Slowly, painfully, Pete regained some control over his trembling limbs. The immediate, life-giving heat spurred him. He looked towards the splintered wood where the lynx had been clawing its way in. The frantic scratching had ceased. Perhaps the sudden flare of light and the growing roar of the fire had startled the beast, reminding it of the ancient fear of Man and his command over flame. Pete listened intently. He heard a low growl, then the sound of muffled paws retreating over the snow outside. The immediate danger from the animal seemed to have passed, deterred by the very fire the last, frail match had birthed.

He turned back to the hearth, feeding the fledgling fire small, dry twigs, then larger pieces of wood he had prepared earlier, hoarding them for this very moment he had almost not lived to see. The flames grew strong and confident, casting dancing shadows across the rough-hewn walls of the small cabin, turning the prison of ice and snow into a sanctuary. The oppressive silence of the frozen world outside was replaced by the comforting crackle and hiss of burning wood.

Pete removed his remaining glove and held his aching, near-frozen hands towards the blaze, groaning softly as the painful thawing began. Sensation returned, sharp and stinging, but welcome nonetheless. He was alive. He had faced the dual specters of freezing and starvation, armed with nothing but a single, last-chance cartridge and a box of seemingly useless matches. And in the end, it wasn't the bullet, nor the sturdy, well-made matches, but the anomaly – the thin, crooked, discolored outcast – that had saved him.

He thought back to the moment he had crushed the box in frustration, the tiny glint he'd seen in the dirt. That match, the one overlooked, perhaps even scorned by its box-mates, had held the spark of his salvation. It had fulfilled its destiny not just by burning, but by succeeding where its "better" brethren had failed. Its very thinness, its crookedness, the strange stiffness from the bark – perhaps these were the very qualities that allowed it to survive the crushing heel, to retain its head, to ignite against the worn fragment of the box when the others could not.

As warmth fully returned to him and the gnawing hunger began to assert itself over the fading terror, Pete reached carefully into the hearth. Amongst the growing bed of embers and ash, he gently retrieved the tiny, charred stick – all that remained of the thin match. It was impossibly fragile, little more than a blackened sliver. He held it in his palm, looking at it with a reverence he had never imagined giving to something so insignificant.

He wouldn't keep it forever; it was too frail, destined to crumble into dust. But for now, he placed it carefully on the rough mantelpiece above the fire. It was a monument, unseen by any eyes but his own, to the improbable. A testament that even the smallest, the most flawed, the most overlooked, could possess the power to change everything, to fulfill a destiny greater than anyone could have predicted. He had survived, thanks to a different story, off the beaten path, a tale of a thin match that had flared brightly against the vast, indifferent cold. The fire roared, life endured, and Pete, humbled and grateful, prepared to face the long days ahead until the thaw, forever marked by the improbable courage of a single, thin match.

Ending 2: The Price of Survival

...the fire caught and roared up the stone chimney. Pete wept, crouching there benumbed, his great body in the ungainly furs sagging down almost against the blaze under the stress of this reaction. The sudden warmth felt like a physical blow, a reprieve so profound it bordered on pain. He was alive. The thin match, the flawed castaway, had done what the others could not. It had given him back the world.

But the world it returned him to was not yet safe. Even as the fire pushed back the deadly cold, the sounds from the breach in the wall reminded him of the other immediate threat. The scratching resumed, more determined now, laced with angry snarls. The lynx, maddened by hunger and perhaps enraged by the sudden light and heat, was not retreating. It was coming.

Pete scrambled back from the hearth, his half-numbed hands fumbling for the rifle he had laid on the bunk. The firelight illuminated the cabin, but it also silhouetted him against the brighter background, making him a clearer target should the beast break through entirely. He chambered the single, precious cartridge. The click echoed unnaturally loud in the small space. There was no room for error. This shot was not just for the lynx; it was for the fire it might extinguish in its death throes, for the provisions it might spoil, for the fragile sanctuary the thin match had just secured.

A large piece of wood splintered inwards, and a savage, tufted head pushed through the opening, eyes gleaming yellow in the firelight. The lynx saw him, saw the fire, and seemed to hesitate for only a fraction of second before launching itself into the cabin with a terrifying scream.

Pete reacted on pure instinct, honed by years in the wild. He raised the rifle, the cold metal biting into his still-aching hands. There was no time to aim carefully, only to point and shoot. The roar of the rifle blast filled the small hut, momentarily deafening him. The recoil slammed the buttstock hard against his shoulder.

The lynx convulsed in mid-air, crashing heavily onto the earthen floor not far from the hearth. It thrashed violently for a few moments, claws tearing at the packed dirt, then lay still. Silence descended again, broken only by the crackling fire and Pete's own ragged breathing.

He lowered the rifle, shaking uncontrollably now, not from cold but from adrenaline and shock. The fire burned brightly, warming the small space, but the air was thick with the smell of gunpowder and the metallic tang of blood. On the floor lay the proof of his desperate gamble: the dead lynx, its thick winter coat marred by the fatal wound, and near the hearth, the invisible ashes of the thin match that had made this outcome possible.

He had survived. He had fire, and the immediate threat was neutralized. But the cost lingered in the air. He had been forced to use his last cartridge. The shot that saved him now also left him defenceless against any future threat, be it another predator or the need to hunt for food should his provisions run low before the thaw.

The thin match had fulfilled its destiny, providing the spark that saved his life. But its sacrifice had only bought him one victory. The North was still vast, cold, and unforgiving. He had warmth, but he was now unarmed, his future hanging precariously on his remaining supplies and the hope of a timely spring. The fire crackled merrily, a beacon of life in the immense desolation, but Pete felt the weight of his isolation, the true fragility of his existence made starkly clear. The thin match had won him the battle, but the war for survival was far from over. He was alive, thanks to that improbable flame, but the echo of the gunshot was a grim reminder of the enduring price of living in the unforgiving wilderness.

Ending 3: Ashes to Ashes, Indifference Reigns

...the fire caught and roared up the stone chimney. Pete wept, crouching there benumbed, his great body in the ungainly furs sagging down almost against the blaze under the stress of this reaction. The heat was life itself, pushing back the encroaching frost-death. For a long moment, he simply absorbed the warmth, the sheer fact of continued existence.

The sounds of the lynx had stopped. Pete strained his ears. Had it fled, spooked by the fire's sudden bloom? Or was it waiting, gathering its courage? He slowly rose, cautiously approaching the breach in the wall. Peering through a crack, he saw nothing but the endless, undulating white of the snowdrifts under the pale, sub-Arctic light. The beast had gone, perhaps deciding the effort of breaking in was too great now that its potential prey was armed with fire.

Relief washed over Pete anew, but it was tempered by exhaustion and the vast indifference of the landscape around him. He secured the breach as best he could with spare timbers, then devoted his attention to the fire, the center of his small universe. He ate sparingly from his provisions, huddled close to the hearth, the silence of the cabin broken only by the fire's cheerful consumption of the wood he fed it.

Days turned into nights, and nights blurred into an endless cycle of tending the fire, rationing food, listening to the wind howl outside, and waiting. The memory of the thin match, the catalyst for his survival, faded quickly. Its brief, heroic flare was consumed by the larger reality of the fire it had started. It had fulfilled its purpose, its singular destiny, and now it was gone, indistinguishable from the other ash in the hearth, its unique flaws, its journey, its moment of critical importance utterly erased.

Pete survived the winter. The snows eventually receded, the river thawed, and the path back to civilization, or at least to a remote outpost, opened up. He packed his meager gear, extinguished the last embers of his long-kept fire, and left the small cabin behind, a tiny, man-made scar on the immense face of the wilderness.

He carried no memory of the specific match. He remembered the desperation, the cold, the lynx, the relief of finding *a* match, *any* match, in the crushed box. But the individual story of the thin, crooked match with the brown streak? That was lost. It had played its vital role, burned brightly for its allotted second, and returned to the elements, just as the tree it came from had, just as Pete himself eventually would.

Its destiny was fulfilled not in Pete's grateful memory, but in the simple, physical fact of the fire it ignited. It was a catalyst, momentarily crucial, ultimately anonymous. The great, impersonal cycle of the North, of life and death, of fire and ice, continued, unimpressed by the brief, desperate drama that had played out in the small cabin. The thin match was ash, scattered by the wind or mixed into the dirt floor, its unique existence dissolved back into the vastness from which it had briefly emerged. Its tale, off the beaten path, ended not with commemoration, but with the quiet, universal return to oblivion.

Ending 4: The Tale of the Flawed Savior

...the fire caught and roared up the stone chimney. Pete wept, crouching there benumbed, his great body in the ungainly furs sagging down almost against the blaze under the stress of this reaction. Life surged back with the heat, potent and undeniable. He was safe, at least for now. The lynx, perhaps deterred by the sudden light and growing heat, had ceased its efforts to break in; Pete heard its frustrated snarls fade into the distance across the snow.

In the days and weeks that followed, Pete husbanded the fire and his resources carefully. The isolation remained, the cold was a constant presence just beyond the cabin walls, but the immediate desperation was gone. He had time to think, huddled by the hearth that represented his salvation. And often, his thoughts returned to that final, desperate moment – not just the finding of the matches, but the failure of the first three, the supposedly good ones, and the astonishing success of the last, flawed survivor.

He remembered crushing the box, the glint of the overlooked match-head in the dirt. He remembered its appearance – thin, streaked, crooked. An outcast even in its own tiny society. He remembered how it had felt in his numb fingers, fragile yet strangely resilient. He remembered the steady flame it produced, the way it clung to life just long enough to pass the torch to the waiting kindling.

It became a focal point in his mind, a symbol of his ordeal and unlikely survival. This wasn't just any match; it was *the* match. The imperfect one. The one that shouldn't have worked, but did.

When the spring thaw finally came and Pete made his arduous journey back towards the nearest settlement, the story was already forming in his mind. He had faced death, stared into the abyss of the frozen wild, and been pulled back by the most improbable of saviors.

Months later, far from the Nasquapee, in the relative warmth and safety of a trading post or perhaps even back home, Pete would tell his story. He’d speak of the weeks snowed in, the dwindling supplies, the relentless cold, the terror of the lynx. He would describe the despair of running out of matches, the accident with the last full box. He’d recount finding the old coat, the surge of hope finding the crushed box, the sickening failure of the first three matches.

And then, his voice would lower, taking on a tone of wonder. He would describe the fourth match, the last one, the one he’d almost missed, the one he’d initially cursed when he found it wedged in the box. "It was a poor thing," he'd say, gesturing with his hands. "Thin as a sliver, it was, with a brown streak down its side like it was diseased, and a head all askew. Looked like it'd break if you breathed on it wrong. The other three, fine, stout-looking matches, they failed me. Broke, crumbled, fizzled out. But this one... this crooked little runt..." He’d pause, letting the moment hang. "It lit. Burned steady and true, just long enough. Saved my life, that worthless-looking match."

The thin match, long since turned to ash and scattered, found a different kind of immortality. Its physical form was gone, its brief flare extinguished. But its essence, its story – the tale of the flawed, overlooked thing that held the spark of salvation when all else failed – lived on. It became part of Pete Jenkins's legend, a reminder passed through smoke-filled rooms and across crackling campfires, that destiny often ignores appearances, and the greatest strength can sometimes be found in the most unexpected, unassuming vessel. Its destiny was not just to burn, but to become a story, forever kindling wonder in the minds of those who heard the tale.

Ending 5: The Lingering Shadow

...the fire caught and roared up the stone chimney. Pete wept, crouching there benumbed, his great body in the ungainly furs sagging down almost against the blaze under the stress of this reaction. The wave of relief was immense, almost drowning. He fed the flames, his hands shaking, his mind slowly processing the narrowness of his escape. The thin match, the unlikely survivor of the crushed box, had flared into life and cheated the freezing death that had been moments away.

The lynx, after a few more frustrated scratches and snarls at the growing light and scent of smoke, eventually retreated, leaving Pete alone with his newfound warmth and safety. He ate, thawed his aching limbs, and eventually fell into an exhausted sleep by the hearth, the fire casting a comforting orange glow.

He survived the winter. The ordeal, however, left a deeper mark than just the memory of cold and fear. The sheer randomness of it all – the chain of events that brought that specific, flawed match to his cabin at that precise moment, the failure of the "good" matches, the success of the "bad" one – settled into his mind not as a miracle, but as a terrifying glimpse into the utter caprice of fate.

He had relied on skill, preparation, and strength to survive in the North, but all of that had been rendered useless. His life had hung by the thread of a single, defective matchstick, found purely by chance after an act of frustration. If he hadn't crushed the box, if the match hadn't been wedged so tightly, if its particular flaw hadn't given it some odd resilience... he would be dead.

This realization bred a new kind of caution in Pete, one that bordered on paranoia. He became obsessed with redundancy, hoarding supplies, checking and rechecking everything. He developed rituals around fire-starting, carrying multiple methods – matches in waterproof cases, flint and steel, magnifying glass – terrified of ever again facing that moment of utter helplessness. The freedom and confidence that had once defined his relationship with the wilderness were replaced by a constant, nagging anxiety.

The thin match had fulfilled its destiny – it had lit the fire. It had saved Pete's life in that moment. But the very improbability of its success became a source of lingering unease for the man it saved. It was a reminder not of hope, but of how incredibly fragile the barrier was between existence and oblivion, how easily the scales could tip based on factors utterly beyond control – like the grain of wood in a single, thin match.

He continued his life as a trapper, but the joy was diminished, overshadowed by the memory of his absolute vulnerability. The fire that the thin match started continued to burn metaphorically in his mind, not just as a symbol of salvation, but as a stark illumination of the terrifying randomness that governed the world. The thin match's legacy wasn't gratitude or a rousing story, but a quiet, persistent fear, a shadow cast by the very flame that had saved him. It had burned brightly, fulfilled its purpose, but in doing so, it had inadvertently kindled a different, colder fire in the survivor's soul.
