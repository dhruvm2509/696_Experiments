**Ending 1: The Unhealthy Compromise**


"Never mind?" Wise echoed, stepping back to let me into his apartment. The door shut out the rainy hallway. "You pound on my door at midnight, sneezing your head off, claiming you've got 'a disease,' and now it's 'never mind'?"

"I just... I misspoke," I mumbled, wiping my nose on my sleeve. The fever was making me dizzy. "It's just a cold, Doc. But maybe... maybe it's a complication? You know, from the... the Hagle's?"

Wise sighed, a long, weary sound that seemed to carry the weight of the past nine months – the inexplicable tests, the media frenzy, the millions pouring into a foundation for a disease with only one, intermittently healthy, patient[cite: 396, 398]. He slumped into a chair, gesturing for me to take the couch.

"William," he said, his voice lacking its usual clinical edge, "we both know those reports. Clean as a whistle[cite: 394]. Healthier than me, probably[cite: 398]. The trustees are getting restless. This 'comes and goes' line won't hold forever[cite: 395, 396]."

"But I *am* sick now!" I protested, letting out a rattling cough for emphasis. "You can test me! Fever, congestion... it's real this time!"

He looked at me, really looked at me, slumped there, shivering, pathetic. He saw the desperation. Maybe he remembered the initial terror in my eyes when he first mentioned leukemia[cite: 373], or the baffling reversal minutes later[cite: 379]. Maybe he saw the millions doing *some* good, funding other research now that "Hagle's Disease" proved elusive. Maybe he just didn't have the stomach to tear it all down.

"Alright, Hagle," he said finally, rubbing his temples. "Alright. You've got an upper respiratory infection. Severe. Given your unique medical history," – he almost smirked saying that – "we'll classify it as a significant relapse event. Needs immediate inpatient observation at Cedars. Full workup."

Relief hit me like a drug. He was covering. He was letting the lie stand, propping it up with a common cold. "Thanks, Doc," I croaked. "You won't regret it."

"Oh, I probably will," he muttered, reaching for his coat. "Come on. Let's get you admitted before you sneeze on the upholstery."

Back in the comfortable private room at Cedars, fussed over by nurses, I felt a wave of conflicted calm. The foundation was safe. My comfortable life continued. The Hexers remained quiet, presumably still waiting for the bond I hadn't bought[cite: 391, 392]. Should I buy it now? Could I even access the funds without raising suspicion? Or had the sheer inertia of the foundation, the collective belief in my non-existent disease, become its own form of protection against them?

Lying there, listening to the rain, I felt a familiar chill that had nothing to do with the fever. Wise had compromised. He'd chosen the path of least resistance, propping up the charade. And I had let him. We were partners now, in a strange way, bound by the lie. The money stayed locked away, the bond unbought. Maybe the Hexers would return, maybe they wouldn't. But I knew, deep down, that even without them, I wasn't healthy. I was living a lie, propped up by cynical compromise, forever the charity case. And that felt like its own kind of sickness.

**Ending 2: The Final Symptom**


"Never mind?" Wise repeated incredulously, pulling me into his apartment out of the rain. "Hagle, you look like death warmed over, you sound like a foghorn, and you tell me 'never mind' after yelling about having 'a disease'?"

I coughed wetly into my hand. "It's just a cold, Doc. I got carried away."

Wise threw his hands up in exasperation. "A cold! That's it! That's the last straw!" His face hardened, the weary intern replaced by an angry, determined physician. "I've suspected for months, Hagle[cite: 394]. Those fluctuating tests[cite: 379, 395], your unnatural 'perfect health'[cite: 398], the lack of any other cases[cite: 396]... It's a fraud, isn't it? The whole damned thing!"

"No! Doc, listen!" Panic seized me. "It's complicated! There are... things... Hexers... from the future! They stopped, waiting for me to pay them! The foundation money..." [cite: 319, 348, 391, 392]

"Hexers?" Wise stared at me as if I'd sprouted tentacles. "Future? Hagle, you're delusional. All that time I defended you, argued with the board, cited those initial contradictory results... and it was all just... madness? Or worse, a con?" He shook his head, bitterness twisting his features. "No more. I'm calling the Chair of the board. I'm calling the Times. It ends tonight."

"Wise, don't! You'll ruin everything! They'll come back!" I pleaded, grabbing his arm.

He pulled away sharply. "Let them! Maybe seeing a real Hexer would be more believable than this! Get out, Hagle. Get out before I call the police too."

He turned his back, already dialing. I stumbled out of his apartment, the door slamming shut behind me like a final judgment. It unraveled fast. Wise's testimony, backed by months of clean medical reports, was irrefutable. "Foundation President Exposed," screamed the headlines. "Hagle's Disease Deemed Hoax."

The money was frozen[cite: 401]. The Cedars suite vanished. The respect, fake as it was, turned to ridicule and contempt. I was back where I started, a bum in a worn-out suit, haunted and broke.

My only thought was the time machine[cite: 314], the bond[cite: 368]. If I could just send the payment, maybe the Hexers would leave me alone even in poverty. I hitchhiked to Edgeway, arriving days later, soaked and starving, at 1467 Claremont.

The house was dark. A 'For Sale' sign hung crookedly on the lawn. Peering through the picture window, I saw empty rooms, dust sheets over non-existent furniture. Miss Tompkins was gone. The machine, my link, my slim hope, was inaccessible, likely dismantled or moved.

I sank down onto the wet porch steps, despair washing over me. It was truly over. No money, no foundation, no way to appease the future.

And then, I felt it. The familiar prickle on the back of my neck[cite: 246]. The sense of being watched. I looked up, scanning the manicured lawns, the identical houses across the street. Nothing. But I knew they were there. The slimy, scaly shapes, lurking just beyond perception[cite: 242, 243]. They knew the deal was off. They knew the money wasn't coming. Their waiting period was over.

A voice, my voice but not mine, whispered out of the empty air, chillingly familiar[cite: 235, 236]. "Payment overdue, William Hagle. Penalties will now accrue."

The real Hagle's Disease, the one they inflicted, was about to begin again. And this time, there was no foundation, no fame, no hope. Only the Hexers, and the endless, inventive torment they specialized in.

**Ending 3: Hexer Ex Machina**


"Never mind?" Wise echoed, ushering me into his sterile apartment. "Hagle, you look half-drowned and you sound worse. What disease is it this time?"

"Just a cold," I admitted miserably, collapsing onto his sofa. "Forget I said anything."

Wise crossed his arms, his expression hardening. "I can't forget, William. The board meeting is next week. They're demanding answers. Months of perfect health reports[cite: 394, 398], no other cases anywhere[cite: 396]... If you can't show me something concrete, something verifiable, the Foundation is finished. And frankly, so are you."

Panic tightened its icy grip. "But Doc, I *am* sick!" I coughed violently, hoping it sounded convincing. "Maybe it affects the tests differently now! Maybe—"

"Maybe it's time to stop lying," Wise cut in coldly. He stepped towards his desk. "I'm sorry, Hagle. I think I have to make a call."

As his fingers reached for the phone, the lights in the apartment flickered wildly[cite: 16]. The air crackled with static electricity. Wise froze, hand hovering over the receiver. A low hum vibrated through the room, seeming to come from the walls themselves.

"What the...?" Wise muttered, looking around nervously.

Suddenly, he gasped and staggered back, clutching his head. "My eyes!" he cried out. "God, what is that?" He stumbled blindly, knocking over a lamp. "Slimy... scales... looking at me!" [cite: 242]

I stared, frozen in shock and dawning horror. He could *see* them. The Hexers. They were here, in Wise's apartment, making themselves visible *to him*.

Just as suddenly as it began, the lights steadied, the humming stopped. Wise blinked rapidly, shaking his head. He looked around the room, then stared at his own hands as if seeing them for the first time. He looked pale and profoundly shaken.

"Did you... did you see...?" he stammered, looking at me with wide, terrified eyes.

I could only nod, mute.

He sank back into his chair, breathing heavily. "Hagle's Disease," he whispered, the words barely audible. "It's... it affects perception. Hallucinations. Auditory... visual..." He was rationalizing, trying to fit the inexplicable horror into a medical box, but the terror in his eyes told a different story. He knew what he saw wasn't just in his head.

He grabbed his prescription pad, his hand shaking uncontrollably. "Severe relapse," he muttered, scribbling furiously. "Acute hallucinatory episode triggered by viral infection. Requires immediate... long-term... specialized care..."

He tore off the sheet and thrust it at me. "Get back to Cedars. Now. Don't talk to anyone else."

I took the paper, my own hand trembling. I had my validation. The Foundation was safe. But the price was terrifying. The Hexers weren't just waiting passively for their money[cite: 392]. They were actively monitoring, willing and able to intervene, to manipulate reality itself to protect their investment – me. They had saved me from Wise, but they had also shown their power, reminded me that I was utterly subject to their control. My cold hadn't proven I had a disease; it had provoked my tormentors into proving they were real, and that my supposed freedom was just another illusion they permitted.

---

**Ending 4: The Quiet Curse**


"Never mind," I repeated, suddenly clear-headed despite the fever. The look on Wise's face – the skepticism, the pity, the weariness [cite: 394] – told me everything. The cold wouldn't work. The lie was crumbling.

"It's okay, Doc," I said, surprisingly calm. "You're right. There's no Hagle's Disease. Not the way people think."

Wise looked startled, then wary. "So... it was all a fraud?"

"Not exactly." And briefly, leaving out the gory details of Thompkins' death, I told him about the Hexers, the future, the time machine, the deal[cite: 319, 321, 348]. He listened silently, his expression unreadable. Maybe he thought I was truly insane now. Maybe, remembering those first tests[cite: 373, 379], he halfway believed me.

"I need to get the money," I finished. "I need to buy the bond and send it back[cite: 368, 348]. It's the only way."

Wise stared at the rain-streaked window for a long time. "The Foundation's charter," he said slowly. "Technically, funds can be allocated for 'experimental treatments aimed at mitigating Hagle's unique psionic and physiological fluctuations'[cite: 384, 397]. Buying a bond to appease futuristic hexers..." He gave a short, humorless laugh. "It's insane. But it fits the charter's loophole better than anything else we've tried."

He made the arrangements. A hefty sum, disguised as a long-term anonymous grant to a "temporal research institute" (a hastily created fiction), was withdrawn. I took the certified check, bought the highest-value government bond available, and made my way back to Edgeway one last time.

Miss Tompkins met me with quiet understanding. Down in the dusty basement, the time machine hummed[cite: 314]. I placed the bond in the transmitter slot. There was a brief shimmer, a pop of displaced air, and it was gone. I sent a coded message confirming transmission, as agreed with Mr. Grimes-Tompkins[cite: 341]. A simple confirmation pulsed back: "Acknowledged. Hexers recalled. Account closed."

I waited for something dramatic. Nothing. No monsters vanished, no voices silenced, because they had already stopped[cite: 392]. I felt... the same. Just a man with a cold standing in a dusty basement.

I left Miss Tompkins' house, stepping out into a world suddenly devoid of unseen malice. The Foundation collapsed quietly weeks later, the official story being that my "remission" was complete and permanent, the disease conquered. Wise faded back into hospital bureaucracy. The money was gone, except for a modest severance the board granted me.

I tried to live a normal life. Got a simple job. Rented a small room. But the silence was deafening. The absence of persecution felt like a phantom limb, constantly itching. I found myself looking over my shoulder, flinching at shadows, mistrusting kindness. Years of being hexed had become my normal; reality felt thin, unreal. The monsters were gone, the voices silent, the bad luck seemingly lifted, but I was still William Hagle. I had my health, finally, undeniably[cite: 3]. But I had no idea what to do with it. The curse was lifted, but the man it had created remained.

---

**Ending 5: The Foundation Prison**


"Never mind," I said quickly, trying to cover my slip. "Just... feeling rough. The disease, you know. Comes and goes[cite: 395]." I forced a weak cough.

Wise pinched the bridge of his nose, looking utterly exhausted. "Hagle, the trustees are meeting Friday. They've seen the reports – months of perfect health[cite: 394, 398]. This 'comes and goes' isn't enough anymore. If this cold is all you've got..."

"It's a manifestation!" I improvised desperately. "A secondary infection! Proves the underlying condition weakens my system! It's classic Hagle's!"

He didn't look convinced, but the alternative – admitting the Foundation was potentially baseless – was clearly unappealing. "Alright," he sighed. "I'll write it up. Severe viral infection secondary to Hagle's Syndrome. We'll put you back in Cedars for observation. Play it up, understand? Look weak."

I understood. Back in the luxurious hospital room, I played the part, while secretly making arrangements. Wise, perhaps eager to solidify the narrative, helped me access a significant chunk of Foundation funds under the guise of an "experimental long-term bio-feedback research investment." It was enough.

I got the bond – the biggest one available[cite: 368]. A clandestine trip back to Edgeway, a quick session with Miss Tompkins and the humming machine[cite: 314], and the payment was sent. Confirmation arrived: Hexers recalled[cite: 349].

And they were gone. Utterly. The visions ceased[cite: 242], the voices stopped[cite: 235], my luck seemed, if not good, at least statistically normal. My health, apart from the lingering cold, felt robust, solid[cite: 3]. I was free from them.

But I wasn't free. I was President Hagle, the face of Hagle's Disease[cite: 390]. My "recovery" from the cold was hailed as another triumph of the Foundation's care. My continued "perfect health" between "episodes" became part of the inspiring narrative. I was trapped in the role more securely than ever.

I had to attend fundraisers, shaking hands, smiling weakly, accepting accolades for my bravery. I had to sit through board meetings, listening to Wise present carefully managed reports on my "condition." I had to give interviews, carefully describing symptoms I no longer felt. My life was a performance.

The wealth wasn't mine; it belonged to the Foundation, fueled by the myth I had to perpetuate. I couldn't walk away without destroying everything – the research funded (for *other* diseases now, ironically), the jobs, the hope people had invested in my name, not to mention facing fraud charges myself.

Brother Partridge thought I was being punished for a sin[cite: 120]. Maybe he was right, but not in the way he imagined. My atonement for killing Thompkins [cite: 138] had led me here. I had bought off the Hexers, only to find myself imprisoned by the very cure. I was healthy, wealthy, and utterly miserable, forever playing the part of the charity case, haunted not by monsters, but by the crushing weight of a successful lie.Here are five potential final chapters/endings for Jim Harmon's "Charity Case":

---

**Ending 1: The Knowing Nod**


Wise stared at me, his face impassive behind his glasses. The rain hammered against the clinic window, mirroring the frantic pounding in my chest. "A cold, Hagle?" he repeated, his voice flat. "Rhinovirus. Millions get it."

"But it's *something*," I insisted, feeling the familiar desperation rise. "It proves I'm not… immune. It proves I can get sick. Like Hagle's Disease. Maybe this is part of it, a new phase?"

He leaned back in his chair, tapping a pen on his desk. He looked tired, older than the young intern I remembered seeing those conflicting test results. He looked like a man who’d seen too much, maybe believed too little. For a long moment, he just studied me, the dripping, anxious president of a multi-million dollar foundation built on… what? A fluctuation? A hex?

I expected dismissal, scorn, maybe even a call to the board members or the press. My whole life felt balanced on the tip of his pen.

Then, slowly, almost imperceptibly, he nodded. Not in agreement, exactly, but in… acceptance? Resignation? "Alright, Hagle," he sighed, pulling a chart towards him. "We'll note it down. Acute nasopharyngitis. Possible complication related to your underlying condition. We'll need to monitor you closely, naturally."

Relief washed over me so hard I nearly buckled. He wasn't buying it, not really. I could see it in his eyes – a deep, weary cynicism. But he wasn't going to fight it. Maybe he figured the foundation did some good anyway. Maybe he pitied me. Maybe he just didn't care enough to unravel the whole mess.

"Thanks, Doc," I mumbled, wiping my nose. "I knew you'd understand."

He just grunted, scribbling on the chart. "Get some rest, Hagle. Drink fluids."

I left the clinic, stepping back out into the rain, the city lights blurring through the downpour. The foundation was safe, for now. My life, built on a lie wrapped around a bizarre truth, could continue. The twenty-dollar bill I’d gotten from Partridge felt heavy in my pocket again, reminding me of the bond, the deal with the future, the Hexers waiting silently for their payoff.

Did I still need to send it? The Hexers hadn't bothered me since the foundation took off. Maybe they were gone for good? Maybe the *belief* of millions, the sheer weight of the Hagle's Disease myth, was enough to keep them at bay? It was tempting to think so. So tempting to just keep the money, enjoy the life I’d stumbled into.

But as I walked through the rain, splashing through puddles, I couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. Not by people this time. By something else. Something patient. Wise hadn't exposed me, but he hadn’t cured me either. He’d just let the ambiguity hang there. And somewhere, in the future or maybe just in the shadows of my own mind, the Hexers waited. Payday postponed, perhaps, but the debt remained. And I, William Hagle, professional victim, charity case, remained fundamentally unhealthy.

---

**Ending 2: The Unraveling**


Wise stared at me for a long moment, then threw back his head and laughed. It wasn’t a pleasant sound. It was harsh, grating, full of disbelief and maybe a touch of hysteria.

"A cold, Hagle?" he finally choked out, wiping his eyes. "You build a multi-million dollar empire on phantom symptoms, on test results that flicker like faulty neon, and now you bring me a *cold* as proof? My God, man, have you no shame?"

The floor seemed to drop out from under me. "But… it's real," I stammered. "I'm sick. I feel terrible."

"You have a cold!" Wise slammed his hand on the desk, his face suddenly furious. "Just like half the city right now! It has nothing to do with your 'Hagle's Disease,' because Hagle's Disease *doesn't exist*! It was a fluke, a mistake, maybe even those… things… you babbled about years ago messing with the tests. But it's not a disease!"

He stood up, pacing behind his desk. "I can't do it, Hagle. I can't keep quiet anymore. People are donating their hard-earned money, pinning their hopes on a fraud. It stops now."

"No! Wise, please!" I begged, panic clawing at my throat. "You don't understand! The Hexers… they'll come back! I need the foundation, the money… I have to pay them!"

He just shook his head, already reaching for the phone. "Hexers? Hagle, you need psychiatric help, not a foundation presidency. It's over."

He made the calls. First to the foundation's board, then to a reporter he knew at the Times. It happened fast, a landslide I couldn't stop. Within hours, the story broke: "Hagle's Disease Exposed as Hoax." The foundation's assets were frozen pending investigation. My name, once synonymous with brave suffering, became a punchline, a symbol of elaborate fraud.

I lost everything. The penthouse apartment, the tailored suits, the respect – fake as it was – it all evaporated. I ended up back on the streets, shivering in the same cheap suit I'd worn into Partridge's mission, only dirtier now. The twenty bucks Partridge had given me was long gone.

Desperate, I made my way back to Edgeway, back to Miss Tompkins' house. Maybe, just maybe, she'd let me use the machine one last time, plead with the future descendants, explain the situation.

The house was dark, abandoned. A foreclosure notice was pasted on the door. Miss Tompkins was gone. The time machine, my only link to the source of my torment and my only hope of ending it, was lost.

I stood there on the rain-slicked porch, broke, disgraced, utterly alone. And then I saw them. Faintly at first, coalescing in the shadows under the dripping trees. The slimy, scaly shapes. They weren't doing anything to a miniature me this time. They were just watching *me*. Waiting. They knew the money wasn't coming. And I knew, with a certainty colder than the November rain, that my lifelong punishment, briefly interrupted by a bizarre detour into fame and fortune, was about to resume with a vengeance.

---

**Ending 3: The Unwelcome Diagnosis**


"It's just a cold, Hagle," Wise said, his voice tired but firm. He reached for a prescription pad. "I'll give you something for the symptoms, but this doesn't validate anything. I still think—"

He stopped mid-sentence. A strange look crossed his face. He blinked rapidly, shaking his head as if trying to clear it. "Odd," he murmured, "just saw… flashing lights." He rubbed his temples.

"You okay, Doc?" I asked, a flicker of unease touching me.

"Fine, fine," he waved it off, but his hand trembled slightly as he tried to write. He dropped the pen. When he bent to retrieve it, he let out a sharp gasp and clutched his chest. His breath came in ragged wheezes.

"Wise!" I stepped forward, alarmed.

He waved me back, struggling for air. "Just… a cramp," he gasped. But his skin had taken on a grayish pallor, and sweat beaded on his forehead. He stumbled back into his chair, eyes wide with sudden, inexplicable terror. "Can't… breathe…"

Suddenly, the lights in the clinic flickered violently. The complex diagnostic monitor beside Wise’s desk flared to life, screen filled with static, then bizarre, shifting symbols that looked disturbingly familiar – like the patterns I sometimes saw at the edge of my vision when the Hexers were near. An electronic screeching filled the room.

Wise stared at the monitor, then at me, raw fear dawning in his eyes. "Hagle… what… what is this?"

"I told you, Doc," I whispered, the old dread returning full force. "They're real. The Hexers."

Just as suddenly as it began, it stopped. The lights steadied. The monitor went blank. Wise took a deep, shuddering breath, the color slowly returning to his face. The chest pain, the breathing difficulty – gone. He looked shaken, disoriented, but physically unharmed.

He stared at me, no longer dismissive or cynical, but with a profound, horrified understanding. "It's true," he breathed. "Everything you told me… it's true."

He didn't need my cold as proof anymore. He’d had his own demonstration. He quickly signed off on my chart, validating the foundation, assuring me of his discretion. I was safe from exposure.

But as I left the clinic, the relief was tainted. The Hexers hadn't just stopped tormenting me; they were capable of affecting others, of intervening directly when their interests – or perhaps their investment in my continued suffering – were threatened. They had saved my foundation, but in doing so, they had reminded me unequivocally that I was still their property. They hadn't been paid off. They were still watching. And my "health," my very reality, was subject to their whims. Wise now believed me, but belief offered no protection. The curse was real, and its power extended far beyond just me.

---

**Ending 4: The Silence of Freedom**


"A cold isn't Hagle's Disease, William," Wise said, his voice unexpectedly gentle. "And frankly, I don't think Hagle's Disease ever existed. But…" he hesitated, looking at the desperation in my eyes. "But maybe it doesn't matter now. You have the resources. You mentioned a debt, something from the future?"

His unexpected understanding threw me off balance. "The bond," I stammered. "I need to send it back. To pay them off. The Hexers."

"Then do it," Wise said simply. "Use the money for what you intended. Maybe that's the cure you really need."

His words hit me harder than any accusation could have. He wasn't going to expose me, but he wasn't validating the lie either. He was pointing towards the truth I’d been avoiding.

Shaken, I left the clinic. I didn't hesitate. I went straight to the bank, liquidated a chunk of foundation stock – justifying it as an investment in "long-term experimental research." I bought the highest-yield, longest-term government bond I could find, enough that its value centuries from now would be astronomical. Then I went to Miss Tompkins.

She was still there, frail but unsurprised. We went down to the basement, the dust thick in the air around the humming machine. Following the instructions I'd received before, I fed the bond into the temporal transmitter. There was a brief shimmer, a hum, and then silence. It was done.

I waited. Days turned into weeks. Nothing happened. The slimy things didn't reappear on the bus. My voice didn't make sarcastic remarks to strangers. No beds were soiled, no items mysteriously appeared in my pockets. The constant, low-level paranoia that had been my companion since childhood began to recede, leaving behind a strange, unnerving quiet.

The Hexers were gone. I was free.

But freedom was… empty. Terrifyingly empty. My entire identity had been shaped by the curse, by the things I saw, the persecution I felt. Without it, who was I? The foundation continued, running on its own momentum and the lingering myth of Hagle's Disease, but my role felt increasingly hollow. I had the wealth, the penthouse, the tailored suits, but they felt like borrowed clothes.

I found myself jumping at shadows, scrutinizing strangers, waiting for the other shoe to drop. I couldn't sleep without the familiar background hum of dread. The silence was louder than any demonic jabbering had ever been.

Wise was right. Sending the bond was the cure I needed – the cure for the Hexers. But there was no cure for being William Hagle, the man who had lived so long with phantoms that reality itself now felt like the most disturbing hallucination of all. I had bought my health, my freedom from the curse, but I was utterly unprepared for the crushing burden of a normal life. The silence stretched before me, vast and empty, and far more frightening than any monster.

---

**Ending 5: The Perpetual Patient**


Wise sighed, running a hand through his thinning hair. "Look, Hagle, a cold is a cold. But…" He paused, perhaps seeing the empire of paperwork and public expectation flash before his eyes. "…but we can classify it as an opportunistic infection exploiting the weakened state caused by Hagle's Disease. It fits the narrative. Keep taking your temperature."

He scribbled something, effectively validating my continued 'illness.' Relief warred with a familiar sense of entrapment. I thanked him, perhaps too effusively, and hurried out. The Foundation was secure.

My next stop was Miss Tompkins'. With the Foundation safe, I could finally fulfill my end of the bargain. Using a discreetly allocated "research grant," I purchased the necessary long-term bond and transmitted it through the humming machine in her basement. Confirmation arrived from the future: debt settled, Hexers recalled.

A profound quiet settled over my life in the following weeks. No more visions, no more voices, no more inexplicable misfortunes. The constant background static of paranoia faded. I was, for the first time I could remember, truly alone in my own head, master of my own actions. I was healthy.

Except, I wasn't allowed to be.

The Hagle's Disease Foundation was more successful than ever. My face adorned fundraising brochures. I gave speeches at glittering galas, describing my 'ongoing battle' with vague, inspirational fortitude. I met with researchers, nodding seriously at complex theories about the non-existent disease bearing my name. I consoled other 'sufferers' – people with genuine, undiagnosed ailments who had latched onto the Hagle's mythos.

I was trapped. Rich, famous, free from the Hexers, but utterly imprisoned by the lie I had created to escape them. Every public appearance, every interview, every sympathetic handshake was a fresh layer cementing me into the role of the perpetual patient, the brave sufferer. The money wasn't truly mine; it belonged to the Foundation, to the image. Walking away meant admitting the fraud, destroying the hope of thousands, and likely facing ruin myself.

Brother Partridge had spoken of atonement. Perhaps this was it. Not punishment for a past life's sin, or even for Thompkins' death, but a bizarre, ironic sentence for the sin of the cure itself. I had traded the torment of the Hexers for the gilded cage of public sympathy. I spent my days surrounded by people, yet utterly isolated by the secret I carried. I finally had my health, the one thing I’d always craved, but I could never, ever admit it. I was William Hagle, the charity case, cured of his curse only to be sentenced to a lifetime of pretending to be sick.
