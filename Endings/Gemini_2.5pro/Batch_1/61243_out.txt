**Ending 1: The Knowing Nod**

"Never mind?" Wise echoed, stepping back to let me into his apartment. The door shut out the rainy hallway. "You pound on my door at midnight, sneezing your head off, claiming you've got 'a disease,' and now it's 'never mind'?" [cite: 404]

"I just... I misspoke," I mumbled, wiping my nose on my sleeve[cite: 404]. The fever was making me dizzy[cite: 400]. "It's just a cold, Doc. But maybe... maybe it's a complication? You know, from the... the Hagle's?"

Wise sighed, a long, weary sound that seemed to carry the weight of the past nine months – the inexplicable tests, the media frenzy, the millions pouring into a foundation for a disease with only one, intermittently healthy, patient[cite: 390, 392, 396]. He slumped into a chair, gesturing for me to take the couch.

"William," he said, his voice lacking its usual clinical edge, "we both know those reports[cite: 394]. Clean as a whistle. Healthier than me, probably[cite: 398]. The trustees are getting restless[cite: 396]. This 'comes and goes' line won't hold forever." [cite: 395]

"But I *am* sick now!" I protested, letting out a rattling cough for emphasis[cite: 400]. "You can test me! Fever, congestion... it's real this time!"

He looked at me, really looked at me, slumped there, shivering, pathetic. He saw the desperation. Maybe he remembered the initial terror in my eyes when he first mentioned leukemia[cite: 373], or the baffling reversal minutes later[cite: 379]. Maybe he saw the millions doing *some* good, funding other research now that "Hagle's Disease" proved elusive[cite: 390]. Maybe he just didn't have the stomach to tear it all down.

"Alright, Hagle," he said finally, rubbing his temples. "Alright. You've got an upper respiratory infection. Severe. Given your unique medical history," – he almost smirked saying that – "we'll classify it as a significant relapse event. Needs immediate inpatient observation at Cedars. Full workup."

Relief washed over me so hard I nearly buckled. He wasn't buying it, not really. I could see it in his eyes – a deep, weary cynicism. But he wasn't going to fight it. Maybe he figured the foundation did some good anyway. Maybe he pitied me. Maybe he just didn't care enough to unravel the whole mess.

"Thanks, Doc," I mumbled, wiping my nose. "I knew you'd understand."

He just grunted, scribbling on the chart. "Get some rest, Hagle. Drink fluids."

I left the clinic, stepping back out into the rain, the city lights blurring through the downpour. The foundation was safe, for now[cite: 390]. My life, built on a lie wrapped around a bizarre truth, could continue. The twenty-dollar bill I’d gotten from Partridge felt heavy in my pocket again[cite: 133], reminding me of the bond, the deal with the future, the Hexers waiting silently for their payoff[cite: 351, 392].

Did I still need to send it? The Hexers hadn't bothered me since the foundation took off[cite: 392]. Maybe they were gone for good? Maybe the *belief* of millions, the sheer weight of the Hagle's Disease myth, was enough to keep them at bay? It was tempting to think so. So tempting to just keep the money, enjoy the life I’d stumbled into.

But as I walked through the rain, splashing through puddles, I couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. Not by people this time[cite: 45]. By something else. Something patient. Wise hadn't exposed me, but he hadn’t cured me either. He’d just let the ambiguity hang there. And somewhere, in the future or maybe just in the shadows of my own mind, the Hexers waited[cite: 319]. Payday postponed, perhaps, but the debt remained. And I, William Hagle, professional victim, charity case, remained fundamentally unhealthy.

**Ending 2: The Unraveling**


"Never mind?" Wise repeated incredulously, pulling me into his apartment out of the rain[cite: 404]. "Hagle, you look like death warmed over, you sound like a foghorn, and you tell me 'never mind' after yelling about having 'a disease'?" [cite: 403]

I coughed wetly into my hand. "It's just a cold, Doc. I got carried away." [cite: 400]

Wise threw his hands up in exasperation. "A cold! That's it! That's the last straw!" His face hardened, the weary intern replaced by an angry, determined physician[cite: 390]. "I've suspected for months, Hagle. Those fluctuating tests[cite: 379, 380], your unnatural 'perfect health'[cite: 398], the lack of any other cases anywhere[cite: 396]... It's a fraud, isn't it? The whole damned thing!"

"No! Doc, listen!" Panic seized me. "It's complicated! There are... things... Hexers... from the future! [cite: 319] They stopped, waiting for me to pay them! [cite: 392] The foundation money..." [cite: 401]

"Hexers?" Wise stared at me as if I'd sprouted tentacles. "Future? Hagle, you're delusional. All that time I defended you, argued with the board, cited those initial contradictory results[cite: 379, 396]... and it was all just... madness? Or worse, a con?" He shook his head, bitterness twisting his features. "No more. I'm calling the Chair of the board. I'm calling the Times. It ends tonight."

"Wise, don't! You'll ruin everything! They'll come back!" I pleaded, grabbing his arm.

He pulled away sharply. "Let them! Maybe seeing a real Hexer would be more believable than this! Get out, Hagle. Get out before I call the police too."

He turned his back, already dialing. I stumbled out of his apartment, the door slamming shut behind me like a final judgment. It unraveled fast. Wise's testimony, backed by months of clean medical reports[cite: 394], was irrefutable. "Foundation President Exposed," screamed the headlines. "Hagle's Disease Deemed Hoax."

The money was frozen[cite: 401]. The Cedars suite vanished[cite: 391]. The respect, fake as it was, turned to ridicule and contempt. I was back where I started, a bum in a worn-out suit, haunted and broke[cite: 41, 174].

My only thought was the time machine, the bond[cite: 314, 351]. If I could just send the payment, maybe the Hexers would leave me alone even in poverty. I hitchhiked to Edgeway, arriving days later, soaked and starving, at 1467 Claremont[cite: 239].

The house was dark, abandoned. A foreclosure notice was pasted on the door. Peering through the picture window, I saw empty rooms, dust sheets over non-existent furniture. Miss Tompkins was gone. The machine, my link, my slim hope, was inaccessible, likely dismantled or moved[cite: 314].

I sank down onto the wet porch steps, despair washing over me. It was truly over. No money, no foundation, no way to appease the future[cite: 321].

And then, I felt it. The familiar prickle on the back of my neck. The sense of being watched[cite: 45]. I looked up, scanning the manicured lawns, the identical houses across the street[cite: 267]. Nothing. But I knew they were there. The slimy, scaly shapes, lurking just beyond perception[cite: 243, 267]. They knew the deal was off[cite: 349]. They knew the money wasn't coming. Their waiting period was over[cite: 392].

A voice, my voice but not mine, whispered out of the empty air, chillingly familiar[cite: 235, 260]. "Payment overdue, William Hagle. Penalties will now accrue."

The real Hagle's Disease, the one they inflicted, was about to begin again. And this time, there was no foundation, no fame, no hope. Only the Hexers, and the endless, inventive torment they specialized in[cite: 21, 252, 320].

**Ending 3: Hexer Ex Machina**

"Never mind?" Wise echoed, ushering me into his sterile apartment[cite: 404]. "Hagle, you look half-drowned and you sound worse. What disease is it this time?" [cite: 403]

"Just a cold," I admitted miserably, collapsing onto his sofa[cite: 400]. "Forget I said anything."

Wise crossed his arms, his expression hardening. "I can't forget, William. The board meeting is next week[cite: 396]. They're demanding answers. Months of perfect health reports[cite: 394], no other cases anywhere[cite: 396]... If you can't show me something concrete, something verifiable, the Foundation is finished. And frankly, so are you."

Panic tightened its icy grip. "But Doc, I *am* sick!" I coughed violently, hoping it sounded convincing. "Maybe it affects the tests differently now! Maybe—"

"Maybe it's time to stop lying," Wise cut in coldly. He stepped towards his desk. "I'm sorry, Hagle. I think I have to make a call."

As his fingers reached for the phone, the lights in the apartment flickered wildly. The air crackled with static electricity. Wise froze, hand hovering over the receiver. A low hum vibrated through the room, seeming to come from the walls themselves.

"What the...?" Wise muttered, looking around nervously.

Suddenly, he gasped and staggered back, clutching his head. "My eyes!" he cried out. "God, what is that?" He stumbled blindly, knocking over a lamp. "Slimy... scales... looking at me!" [cite: 243]

I stared, frozen in shock and dawning horror. He could *see* them. The Hexers[cite: 319]. They were here, in Wise's apartment, making themselves visible *to him*.

Just as suddenly as it began, the lights steadied, the humming stopped. Wise blinked rapidly, shaking his head. He looked around the room, then stared at his own hands as if seeing them for the first time. He looked pale and profoundly shaken.

"Did you... did you see...?" he stammered, looking at me with wide, terrified eyes.

I could only nod, mute.

He sank back into his chair, breathing heavily. "Hagle's Disease," he whispered, the words barely audible. "It's... it affects perception. Hallucinations. Auditory... visual..." [cite: 383] He was rationalizing, trying to fit the inexplicable horror into a medical box, but the terror in his eyes told a different story. He knew what he saw wasn't just in his head.

He grabbed his prescription pad, his hand shaking uncontrollably. "Severe relapse," he muttered, scribbling furiously. "Acute hallucinatory episode triggered by viral infection. Requires immediate... long-term... specialized care..."

He tore off the sheet and thrust it at me. "Get back to Cedars[cite: 391]. Now. Don't talk to anyone else."

I took the paper, my own hand trembling. I had my validation. The Foundation was safe[cite: 390]. But the price was terrifying. The Hexers weren't just waiting passively for their money[cite: 392]; they were actively monitoring, willing and able to intervene, to manipulate reality itself to protect their investment – me. They had saved me from Wise, but they had also shown their power, reminded me that I was utterly subject to their control. My cold hadn't proven I had a disease; it had provoked my tormentors into proving they were real, and that my supposed freedom was just another illusion they permitted.

**Ending 4: The Quiet Curse**

"Never mind," I repeated, suddenly clear-headed despite the fever[cite: 400, 404]. The look on Wise's face – the skepticism, the pity, the weariness [cite: 394, 398] – told me everything. The cold wouldn't work. The lie was crumbling.

"It's okay, Doc," I said, surprisingly calm. "You're right. There's no Hagle's Disease. Not the way people think."

Wise looked startled, then wary. "So... it was all a fraud?"

"Not exactly." And briefly, leaving out the gory details of Thompkins' death, I told him about the Hexers, the future, the time machine, the deal [cite: 314, 319, 341-349]. He listened silently, his expression unreadable. Maybe he thought I was truly insane now. Maybe, remembering those first tests[cite: 373, 379], he halfway believed me.

"I need to get the money," I finished. "I need to buy the bond and send it back. It's the only way." [cite: 351, 401]

Wise stared at the rain-streaked window for a long time. "The Foundation's charter," he said slowly[cite: 397]. "Technically, funds can be allocated for 'experimental treatments aimed at mitigating Hagle's unique psionic and physiological fluctuations'[cite: 384, 397]. Buying a bond to appease futuristic hexers..." He gave a short, humorless laugh. "It's insane. But it fits the charter's loophole better than anything else we've tried."

He made the arrangements. A hefty sum, disguised as a long-term anonymous grant to a "temporal research institute" (a hastily created fiction), was withdrawn. I took the certified check, bought the highest-value government bond available[cite: 351, 368], and made my way back to Edgeway one last time.

Miss Tompkins met me with quiet understanding[cite: 286]. Down in the dusty basement, the time machine hummed[cite: 314]. I placed the bond in the transmitter slot. There was a brief shimmer, a pop of displaced air, and it was gone. I sent a coded message confirming transmission, as agreed with Mr. Grimes-Tompkins[cite: 341, 346]. A simple confirmation pulsed back: "Acknowledged. Hexers recalled. Account closed." [cite: 349]

I waited for something dramatic. Nothing. The slimy things didn't reappear on the bus[cite: 243]. My voice didn't make sarcastic remarks to strangers[cite: 235, 260]. No beds were soiled[cite: 8], no items mysteriously appeared in my pockets[cite: 31]. The constant, low-level paranoia that had been my companion since childhood began to recede[cite: 6], leaving behind a strange, unnerving quiet.

The Hexers were gone. I was free.

But freedom was… empty. Terrifyingly empty. My entire identity had been shaped by the curse, by the things I saw[cite: 20], the persecution I felt[cite: 320]. Without it, who was I? The Foundation collapsed quietly weeks later, the official story being that my "remission" was complete and permanent, the disease conquered[cite: 390]. Wise faded back into hospital bureaucracy. The money was gone, except for a modest severance the board granted me.

I tried to live a normal life. Got a simple job. Rented a small room. But the silence was deafening. The absence of persecution felt like a phantom limb, constantly itching. I found myself looking over my shoulder, flinching at shadows, mistrusting kindness. Years of being hexed had become my normal; reality felt thin, unreal. The monsters were gone[cite: 20], the voices silent[cite: 260], the bad luck seemingly lifted[cite: 384], but I was still William Hagle. I had my health, finally, undeniably. But I had no idea what to do with it. The curse was lifted, but the man it had created remained.

**Ending 5: The Foundation Prison**

"Never mind," I said quickly, trying to cover my slip[cite: 404]. "Just... feeling rough. The disease, you know. Comes and goes." [cite: 395] I forced a weak cough[cite: 400].

Wise pinched the bridge of his nose, looking utterly exhausted[cite: 394, 398]. "Hagle, the trustees are meeting Friday[cite: 396]. They've seen the reports – months of perfect health. This 'comes and goes' isn't enough anymore. If this cold is all you've got..."

"It's a manifestation!" I improvised desperately. "A secondary infection! Proves the underlying condition weakens my system! It's classic Hagle's!"

He didn't look convinced, but the alternative – admitting the Foundation was potentially baseless – was clearly unappealing. "Alright," he sighed. "I'll write it up. Severe viral infection secondary to Hagle's Syndrome. We'll put you back in Cedars for observation[cite: 391]. Play it up, understand? Look weak."

I understood. Back in the luxurious hospital room, I played the part, while secretly making arrangements. Wise, perhaps eager to solidify the narrative, helped me access a significant chunk of Foundation funds under the guise of an "experimental long-term bio-feedback research investment." It was enough.

I got the bond – the biggest one available[cite: 351, 368]. A clandestine trip back to Edgeway, a quick session with Miss Tompkins and the humming machine[cite: 314], and the payment was sent. Confirmation arrived: Hexers recalled[cite: 349].

And they were gone. Utterly. The visions ceased[cite: 20], the voices stopped[cite: 260], my inexplicable misfortunes ended[cite: 8, 25, 31]. The constant background static of paranoia faded. I was, for the first time I could remember, truly alone in my own head, master of my own actions. I was healthy.

Except, I wasn't allowed to be.

The Hagle's Disease Foundation was more successful than ever[cite: 388, 390]. My face adorned fundraising brochures. I gave speeches at glittering galas, describing my 'ongoing battle' with vague, inspirational fortitude. I met with researchers, nodding seriously at complex theories about the non-existent disease bearing my name. I consoled other 'sufferers' – people with genuine, undiagnosed ailments who had latched onto the Hagle's mythos.

I was trapped. Rich, famous, free from the Hexers, but utterly imprisoned by the lie I had created to escape them. Every public appearance, every interview, every sympathetic handshake was a fresh layer cementing me into the role of the perpetual patient, the brave sufferer. The money wasn't truly mine; it belonged to the Foundation, to the image[cite: 401]. Walking away meant admitting the fraud, destroying the hope of thousands, and likely facing ruin myself.

Brother Partridge had spoken of atonement[cite: 126]. Perhaps this was it. Not punishment for a past life's sin[cite: 124], or even for Thompkins' death[cite: 138], but a bizarre, ironic sentence for the sin of the cure itself. I had bought off the Hexers, only to find myself imprisoned by the very cure. I was healthy, wealthy, and utterly miserable, forever playing the part of the charity case, cured of my curse only to be sentenced to a lifetime of pretending to be sick.
