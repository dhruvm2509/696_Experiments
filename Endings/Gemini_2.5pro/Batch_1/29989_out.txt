**Ending 1: The Art of Concession**


The heavy doors swung open, admitting a blast of surprisingly warm air and the roar of the assembled crowd – a meticulously orchestrated sound wave that washed over Space Marshal Hennings. He squared his shoulders, adjusted the hang of the ridiculous sword, and stepped out onto the balcony, Commodore Miller hovering anxiously at his elbow. The sunlight, reflecting off the white stone and polished metal below, was indeed intense.

The procession across the square was precisely as tedious as Hennings had anticipated. The honor guard moved with excruciating slowness, the cheers rose and fell with metronomic regularity, and the path carefully skirted the antiquated hulk of the spaceship, allowing maximum exposure to the sun and the populace. Hennings managed a series of gracious nods, pausing as briefed before the capitol steps for a few well-chosen, utterly meaningless platitudes about shared heritage and future cooperation, delivered with practiced sincerity.

Inside the conference hall, the air conditioning was a blessed relief. The Polluxian delegation, led by an equally bemedalled and uncomfortable-looking Grand Admiral Thorne, awaited them. Introductions were made, pleasantries exchanged, and finally, they settled around the vast, polished table, aides positioning themselves like pieces on a chessboard.

The negotiations began, unfolding over days with the predictable rhythm of a ritual dance. Proposals were made, couched in layers of diplomatic ambiguity. Counter-proposals followed, equally oblique. Experts debated obscure points of interstellar law and historical precedent concerning Mirelli's Star and the Agohki system. Hennings found himself admiring Grand Admiral Thorne’s technique; the man was a master of the implied threat wrapped in courteous language.

Hennings, however, played a different game. He focused less on direct confrontation and more on procedural maneuvering and the subtle exploitation of Polluxian pride. He allowed Thorne to win minor points related to prisoner repatriation protocols and the wording of historical summaries, conceding with feigned reluctance that drew faint smiles of satisfaction from the Polluxian side. He introduced complex sub-committees to study "cultural exchange potentials" in the disputed systems, packing them with economic experts disguised as anthropologists.

His masterstroke came during the debate over Agohki VII. Knowing the Polluxians were sensitive about the Ursan Federation's "secret" base revealed by their message interception, Hennings offered a stunning concession: Ursan would publicly acknowledge the base's existence and agree to joint inspections… in return for "minor adjustments" to trade tariffs and resource exploitation rights within the *entire* Agohki system, framed as necessary logistical support for the inspection teams.

Thorne, eager to score a public point by forcing Ursan transparency, readily agreed, focusing on the political victory of the acknowledged base. The economic clauses seemed trivial by comparison.

Days later, the treaty was signed amidst mutual pronouncements of a new era of peace and understanding. The Polluxians celebrated what they saw as a diplomatic triumph – forcing concessions and acknowledgements from the Ursans. Back in the Ursan suite, however, Hennings reviewed the final analysis from his economic team. The tariff adjustments and resource rights quietly secured in the Agohki system effectively gave the Ursan Federation economic dominance there, rendering direct political control almost irrelevant. The Polluxians could keep their "Twin Empire" name; Ursan had secured the real prize.

"A most satisfactory outcome, wouldn't you say, Commodore?" Hennings remarked, finally lighting the cigar he'd been anticipating.

"Indeed, sir," Miller beamed. "Grand Admiral Thorne seemed quite pleased with himself."

"Let him be," Hennings puffed contentedly. "In diplomacy, my boy, the most effective victory is often the one your opponent celebrates as his own. We’ve simply helped them achieve a truly fabulous Pyrrhic success."

**Ending 2: The Joint Committee for Mutual Assured Stupidity**



The procession across the sun-drenched square unfolded with agonizing slowness, a perfectly choreographed display of martial boredom. Hennings endured the staged cheers, the blinding reflections, and the weight of his ceremonial sword, delivering his bland remarks at the capitol steps with the weary professionalism of long practice. Inside the cool, dim conference hall, Grand Admiral Thorne and the Polluxian delegation awaited, their expressions mirroring the Ursans' own blend of formal cordiality and underlying cynicism.

The negotiations commenced. Days blurred into a tedious cycle of proposals, counter-proposals, and adjournments for "further study." Both Hennings and Thorne were masters of the game, adept at parrying thrusts with procedural delays and burying significant points under mountains of trivial amendments. The carefully managed "war" outside continued its gentle simmer, providing background noise but little leverage, as both sides knew the casualty reports and captured cruisers were merely stage dressing.

The sticking point became the formal designation of the disputed border zone between Mirelli's Star and the Agohki system. Neither side would yield sovereignty, yet both implicitly understood that continued low-level "conflict" was becoming economically tiresome and politically repetitive.

After weeks of deadlock, during a session marked by particularly eloquent obfuscation from both sides, Hennings leaned back. "Grand Admiral," he proposed, his tone suggesting a sudden, brilliant compromise, "perhaps we are approaching this incorrectly. Rather than defining a static border, which historical precedent shows is merely an invitation to future disagreement, might we consider a more… dynamic solution?"

Thorne looked wary but intrigued. "Continue, Marshal."

"Let us establish," Hennings suggested, "a Joint Ursan-Polluxian Commission for the Continual Reassessment of Mutual Boundaries and Interstellar Harmony. This commission, composed equally of delegates from both our powers, would meet biannually to re-evaluate the precise demarcation based on shifting stellar drift, navigational necessity, and prevailing cultural currents."

A murmur went through the Polluxian delegation. Thorne stroked his chin. "An interesting concept, Marshal. It acknowledges the fluidity of the situation. How would administrative control be determined between reassessments?"

"Perhaps," Hennings offered magnanimously, "control could alternate. For six months, Ursan administers traffic control and resource monitoring; for the next six months, the Twin Empire assumes these duties."

Commodore Miller choked slightly beside him, but Hennings ignored him. Thorne conferred briefly with his aides. The sheer bureaucratic complexity, the potential for endless procedural wrangling within the commission itself, seemed to appeal to their sensibilities. It offered infinite opportunities for future diplomatic maneuvering without the inconvenience of actual fighting.

"Marshal Hennings," Thorne announced finally, "the Twin Empire finds merit in your far-sighted proposal. We accept."

The final treaty, hailed as a landmark of creative diplomacy, established the Joint Commission and its alternating administrative schedule. Both sides declared victory and the dawn of a new era. Back in their suite, Commodore Miller looked bewildered.

"Sir," he stammered, "with all due respect… what have we actually achieved? This alternating control, the biannual reassessments… it sounds like utter chaos!"

Hennings smiled wearily, lighting a cigar. "Precisely, Commodore. We have achieved the perfect stalemate. Nothing changes, yet everything appears to be in flux. We avoid war, they avoid war, and both our governments can claim to be actively managing the situation through perpetual negotiation. We haven't won peace; we've merely institutionalized the absurdity. Sometimes, the only way to end a pointless conflict is to make the peace equally pointless, but impressively bureaucratic."

**Ending 3: The Unscheduled Riot**


Marshal Hennings endured the sun-baked march across the square, delivered his vacuous speech, and finally reached the cool sanctuary of the conference hall. Grand Admiral Thorne and his Polluxian counterparts greeted them with practiced smiles. The intricate dance of diplomacy began, proposals and counter-proposals weaving a complex pattern of feigned disagreement.

Outside, the carefully managed "war" continued its simulated course. Hennings received daily updates: the minor skirmish here, the polite capture there, the ongoing, fruitless attempts to suborn General Nilssen. Blauvelt's propaganda teams were reportedly preparing for the civilian riots planned to coincide with the conference's climax, designed to pressure the Polluxians into minor concessions on Agohki VII.

It was during the fourth day of negotiations, while debating the historical significance of a minor asteroid belt near Mirelli’s Star, that the first unscheduled report arrived. An aide slipped a data slate to Commodore Miller, who scanned it with visible alarm. He leaned over to whisper urgently in Hennings’ ear.

"Sir! The riots on Agohki VII… they’ve started prematurely. And reports indicate… well, sir, they seem considerably more violent than planned. Significant property damage… casualties among local security forces…"

Hennings kept his face impassive, nodding slightly as if receiving confirmation of a dinner reservation. "Continue the presentation, Doctor," he instructed the Ursan historian currently holding the floor, while his mind raced. Premature? More violent? Had Blauvelt’s team miscalculated, or had local elements seized the opportunity?

Minutes later, another urgent message arrived, this time for the Polluxians. Grand Admiral Thorne excused himself briefly, conferring with his own agitated aides. When he returned to the table, the mask of diplomatic cordiality had slipped, replaced by a look of grim concern.

"Marshal Hennings," Thorne said, his voice tight, "we are receiving disturbing reports from Agohki VII. It seems Ursan-sponsored elements are engaging in widespread violence and insurrection."

"Grand Admiral," Hennings replied smoothly, affecting surprise, "I assure you, any disturbances must be spontaneous expressions of local sentiment. The Ursan Federation naturally deplores violence."

Before Thorne could retort, both delegations were jolted by a priority alert flashing on the main screen. A live news feed, bypassing official channels, showed chaotic scenes from Agohki VII – burning buildings, running crowds, and unmistakable sounds of heavy weapons fire. Worse, the feed clearly showed troops identified as Polluxian regulars firing into a crowd containing Ursan civilians.

The carefully constructed facade shattered. The polite fiction of controlled conflict evaporated. This was real, messy, and escalating. Thorne’s face went pale with fury. Miller looked terrified.

"Marshal," Thorne growled, "this… this is an outrage! An act of war!"

Hennings felt a cold knot in his stomach. The game had gone off-script. "Grand Admiral," he said, his voice hardening, dropping the diplomatic softness, "we see Polluxian troops firing on unarmed civilians. That requires immediate explanation and cessation."

The conference dissolved into chaos. Accusations flew. Aides scrambled for information, trying to contact their respective military commands, who were likely just as confused. The choreographed peace conference had suddenly become the backdrop for the potential outbreak of actual war.

Hennings realized with grim certainty that all their intricate plans, their staged battles and polite captures, were meaningless now. They were facing a genuine crisis, born from the unintended consequences of their own cynical game. The diplomatic victory he had planned was irrelevant. Now, the challenge was to prevent the carefully simulated conflict from erupting into a real, bloody catastrophe – a task for which their years of playing war had left them utterly unprepared. The outbreak of peace had ironically triggered the potential for actual war.

**Ending 4: The Bottom Line**


The ceremonial walk across the square was, if anything, more tedious in reality than in anticipation. Hennings endured the glare and the synthetic cheers, delivered his lines, and finally settled into the blessedly cool conference hall opposite Grand Admiral Thorne. The familiar ballet of negotiation began, focusing on star systems, borders, and meticulously documented, minor military engagements.

While Hennings expertly parried Thorne’s points about Mirelli's Star and feigned deep consideration of Polluxian claims in the Agohki system, his attention was only partially on the proceedings. His real focus was on the discreet updates relayed periodically by Commodore Miller, originating from the large, patient civilian advisor responsible for economic strategy – a man named Volkov who rarely spoke at the main table.

Volkov, Hennings knew, was playing a different game entirely, using the conference merely as cover. The prisoner exchanges, ostensibly for humanitarian reasons, had allowed for the insertion of key economic operatives. The diplomatic channels, buzzing with formal protests and proposals, carried coded financial instructions. The entire, elaborate military charade was a distraction, designed to keep the Polluxians focused on maps and fleet dispositions while Volkov targeted their economic weak points.

On the third day, as Hennings was deeply engaged in a manufactured argument over the interpretation of a century-old mining treaty, Miller slipped him a note: "Volkov reports Phase One successful. Polluxian currency destabilized -3%." Hennings nodded imperceptibly.

On the fifth day, during a deadlock over inspection rights for captured cruisers, another note: "Phase Two complete. Ursan consortium has secured controlling interest in Castor Freightways via neutral proxies." This was key – Castor Freightways handled the bulk of interstellar shipping for the entire Polluxian sector.

Hennings noticed a subtle shift in Grand Admiral Thorne’s demeanor over the next two days. Minor points that had previously been subjects of intense debate were suddenly conceded with surprising ease. The Polluxian negotiators seemed distracted, their arguments lacking their earlier conviction. Clearly, news of the economic turmoil was reaching them, though they likely hadn’t connected it directly to the Ursan delegation.

The breakthrough came swiftly after that. Thorne suddenly proposed a compromise on the disputed systems that heavily favored Ursan interests, asking only for face-saving clauses regarding cultural sovereignty. Hennings accepted with feigned reluctance, expressing admiration for Polluxian magnanimity.

The peace treaty was signed. Both sides publicly lauded the spirit of compromise. Later, in the Ursan suite, Volkov delivered his final report.

"Marshal, the Polluxian economy is effectively crippled for the foreseeable future. Their currency is down nearly fifteen percent, and with our control of Castor Freightways, their interstellar trade is entirely dependent on our goodwill. Militarily, they can posture all they like, but economically, they are now a subsidiary."

Hennings puffed on his cigar, savoring the moment. The maps, the borders, the staged battles – they were irrelevant. The real victory had been won not on phantom battlefields or at the negotiating table, but on the stock exchanges and in the corporate boardrooms.

"Excellent work, Volkov," Hennings said. "It seems the pen is mightier than the sword, but the ledger is mightiest of all." He looked at the signed treaty replica on the table. "We let them keep their Twin Empire. We just bought the controlling shares." The outbreak of peace was merely the formal closing statement on a successful corporate takeover.

**Ending 5: The Indigenous Element**


Marshal Hennings completed the sun-drenched, ceremonial trek across the square, offered his bland pleasantries, and settled into the conference hall opposite Grand Admiral Thorne. The negotiations commenced, following the well-worn paths of diplomatic discourse. Reports on the carefully managed skirmishes and prisoner exchanges arrived daily, confirming that the "war" proceeded according to the unwritten script.

Hennings, however, kept a keen eye on Blauvelt, the propaganda chief. Before the conference, Hennings had indiscreetly probed about plans involving an indigenous race on one of the contested planets – Mirelli IV, protected under the Terran Convention. Blauvelt had been evasive, but Hennings suspected something significant was planned, a potential trump card beyond the usual staged riots.

As the conference dragged into its second week, deadlocked over minor territorial claims, the first news reports filtered in, seemingly unrelated to the Ursan-Polluxian conflict. Reports from Mirelli IV spoke of growing unrest among the nonhuman natives, citing grievances against Polluxian colonial administrators interfering with ancient religious sites. The initial reports were minor, easily dismissed by the Polluxian delegation as internal matters.

Then, Blauvelt’s operation escalated. Carefully edited videos surfaced on galactic news networks, purportedly smuggled out by Ursan sympathizers. They showed Polluxian troops in seemingly aggressive postures near native shrines, juxtaposed with heart-wrenching interviews with distressed native elders (carefully coached by Ursan agents, Hennings presumed). The narrative skillfully painted the Polluxians not just as territorial aggressors against Ursan, but as callous oppressors of a protected primitive culture.

The effect was immediate and dramatic. Humanitarian groups across the galaxy expressed outrage. Neutral systems, previously indifferent to the Ursan-Polluxian squabble, began to condemn the Twin Empire. The Terran Convention oversight committee announced an emergency investigation.

At the conference table, the atmosphere shifted drastically. Grand Admiral Thorne and his delegation found themselves on the defensive, forced to spend valuable negotiating time refuting allegations and dealing with a public relations nightmare. Their focus wavered; their demands regarding Mirelli's Star and Agohki suddenly seemed petty in the face of galaxy-wide condemnation.

Hennings pressed his advantage, adopting a tone of sorrowful understanding. He spoke of the need for stability, for respecting indigenous rights, subtly linking a resolution of the Ursan-Polluxian conflict with a restoration of Polluxian credibility. He offered generous terms on the original territorial disputes, framing them as concessions necessary to allow the Twin Empire to focus on addressing the "unfortunate situation" on Mirelli IV.

Thorne, under immense pressure from his own government and galactic opinion, reluctantly agreed. The peace treaty was signed, granting the Ursan Federation nearly all its strategic objectives. The victory was hailed as a triumph of diplomacy and enlightened concern for native rights.

Back in the Ursan suite, Blauvelt accepted Hennings’ quiet congratulations with practiced modesty.

"A masterful campaign, Blauvelt," Hennings acknowledged, lighting his cigar. "You turned a minor clause in the Terran Convention into our most effective weapon."

"The indigenous population proved remarkably… photogenic, sir," Blauvelt demurred. "Their grievances were quite genuine, of course. We merely helped amplify their voices at a strategically opportune moment."

Hennings smiled thinly. The carefully balanced casualties, the staged captures, the intricate diplomatic feints – all were ultimately less decisive than a well-timed, expertly manipulated wave of public sentimentality. The war hadn't been won by fleets or armies, or even procedural tricks, but by propaganda turning the abstract conflict into a relatable drama. The outbreak of peace arrived courtesy of manufactured outrage.
