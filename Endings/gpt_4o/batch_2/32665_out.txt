Ending 1: The scouter landed near the _Marco Four_ with a soft thud. Gibson's hands were gentle as he maneuvered Farrell gently to the ground. The wet grass felt cool beneath the soles of his feet as he fought to steady himself. Each step came with pins and needles that surged and faded like the tide, but it was a welcome reminder that he was still alive, still human.

Stryker rushed out from the ship, his face lined with concern and exhaustion. "Arthur, thank God! Gib, what kind of insane stunt—"

"Easy, Lee," Gibson interrupted, holding up a calming hand. "I understand now. It's all connected."

Farrell lowered himself onto a moss-covered log with a sigh, still feeling a slight chill from the sea breeze. "Start explaining, Gib. From the top."

Gibson nodded, wiping sweat from his brow. "The city was always there, beneath the waterline. Hidden, because that's the only place the natives knew they'd be safe. I was looking in all the wrong places. You saw the octopods carry one of their own away safely. They live both onshore and below. They built their habitats beneath the tides, and only ventured above when absolutely necessary."

Stryker looked between them, frown lines deepening. "Why the theatrics then? Why let themselves be picked off by the lizards day after day?"

"It's a deal," Gibson said grimly. "A balancing act between the hunters and the hunted. They sacrifice two of their own each morning to the lizards, and in return, the octopods are left alone to live in peace below. It keeps the ecosystem running and keeps the lizards fed and away from greater disruptions. They know this, and they abide by it strictly."

Farrell shook his head, incredulous. "A civilization of sacrifice. And we're supposed to colonize here?"

"Perhaps we shouldn't," Stryker said, crossing his arms. "It sounds like any interference from us could spell disaster for their entire culture."

Gibson raised an eyebrow as he recalled what they'd witnessed. "Perhaps. Yet this way of life is built upon a harsh necessity. Still, it's a kind of equilibrium."

A cloud passed over Farrell's face. "What happens if we upset the balance, Gib? If we interfere, if we try to 'assist' without understanding?"

"We might unravel their balance," Gibson replied heavily. "It was the same with every interaction human colonies had with alien ecologies in the past. But that Anderson-Smith treaty—any alterations to the natural balance are strictly prohibited."

Stryker looked out toward the horizon as both the sun and its counterpart below began their climb, casting the world in a soft wash of orange and red. "This world's nature is cruel, but it's theirs. Whatever we do next—whether we report, observe, or choose to reassign—we would have to tread lightly."

The sound of waves filled the space between them, mingling with the rustle of the tall grasses. Farrell's mind wandered to their initial reason for being here; to assess potential. Yet in their brief exploration, they'd seen far more potential within the land's inhabitants than the land itself.

"They need time," Gibson said at last. "Time and space untouched. We came searching for cities and found an equilibrium instead. A pact that sustains life in a way we've forgotten."

Stryker nodded, the exhausted nights catching up with him. "Then we observe. Inform command that colonization isn't feasible under current circumstances and let them work it out."

Gibson knelt, tracing arcs in the dirt. "Maybe one day they'll invite us to visit—understanding begets trust, perhaps."

Farrell, burying hands deep inside his pockets, managed a renewed surge of hope amidst the complexities. "We need more learning, more listening. It could be a decades-long study."

"Let it be longer," Stryker said, turning toward the ship. "For now, let's make sure yesterday's impression is properly reported."

The trio returned to the _Marco_, leaving behind them the tangled web of life that sprawled outward from the sea. Once on board, they sent their findings back across the stars, mindful of the weighty implications of every word.

The crew spent the long return voyage discussing implications and tinkering with new ideas awakened by their discovery. And far below the waves, an unseen city continued its vibrant life, unaffected by the fleeting visitation of three curious humans—content for the moment within the rhythms of its natural dance.

Ending 2: The scouter touched down gently on the dew-laden turf next to the _Marco Four_. Gibson scrambled out, pulling Farrell with him, steadying the taller man as he swayed unsteadily on legs still tingling from the aftereffects of the paralysis.

"Easy now, Arthur," Gibson said, gently nudging him towards the waiting ship. "We just need to get you inside and safe."

The familiar confines of the _Marco Four_ enveloped them as they entered, its machinery softly humming the soundtrack of safety and shelter. Stryker's slumped figure remained undisturbed by the sudden return, breathing steadily in his chemically induced sleep.

Farrell sank into a chair, his mind still swirling with fragmented images. Gibson wasted no time, pacing back and forth with barely contained energy. "The city, Arthur," he said at last, his voice electric with discovery. "It's a marvel. A vast, bio-engineered construct submerged beneath the sea. I should have known."

Questions fought for prominence in Farrell's mind. "But... how did they build it, Gib, and why are they sacrificing themselves on that wretched islet?"

Gibson stopped pacing, turning to face him with earnest eyes. "We misjudged their intelligence from the start," he said. "The Arzians aren't primitive; they're symbiotic. They live in partnership with the life around them—the flying-lizards, the octopods. The sacrifices... they're not what they seem."

He sat down beside Farrell, speaking more softly. "The Arzians can't swim, you're right about that. But their underwater city, that's their real habitat. They only come ashore for a part of their lifecycle, and those we saw on the islet... they weren't sacrifices in any traditional sense. It's a return, a necessary part of their cycle."

Farrell's brows furrowed as the pieces rearranged themselves in his mind. "So they're voluntarily taken back... as what? Some kind of renewal?"

Gibson nodded. "Yes, Arthur, renewal. They're reborn, in a way. The creatures of the sea are partners in this dance. The city itself is a living entity, of sorts, built to adapt and thrive beneath the waves. It's a city that lives alongside its inhabitants rather than standing apart."

A quiet awe replaced the earlier tension in the cabin. Stryker, stirring now, blinked himself awake and mumbled a question as the residue of the dissolving tablet faded into alertness.

"We've stumbled onto something remarkable, Lee," Farrell said softly, meeting Stryker's gaze. "Gib found his city, or what was left of the idea we had of it. Something far more complex and wondrous."

Stryker rubbed his eyes, sitting up straighter as he took in the two figures before him. "Gib? What did you uncover?"

Gibson grinned, the exuberance of his findings still lighting his features. "A thriving civilization, Lee, one that defies our concepts of construction and society. We've glimpsed the true essence of Arz—an intricate balance of dependencies, symbiosis, and regeneration."

"You're certain?" Stryker asked, the skepticism of long-duty settled into his expression but already softening under the weight of Gibson's conviction.

"As certain as I've ever been," Gibson replied. "It changes everything we know about colonization here. We couldn't possibly intrude without disrupting this balance."

The enormity simmered among them, energizing the air with unspoken realization. If relics like these lay hidden on remote planets, what vast expanse of knowledge and alliances had Earth yet to uncover in its journeys?

"It makes you wonder," Farrell murmured, "how many more secrets the universe holds, just waiting to be unraveled. And what our place might be in this grand tapestry."

Stryker's expression shifted into something like acceptance. "Guess we need another plan then," he said, his voice settled with respect for the unknown they've touched. "This changes our mission priorities. We'll have to rethink where and how humanity might make a home here, but that's a challenge for tomorrow."

"And a privilege," Gibson added quietly, glancing out towards the sea. The early morning sun cast shimmering patterns on the water, each ripple a testament to the mysteries lying beneath, the warming light encapsulating the promise of endless exploration.

As they settled into the routine of data collation and reports, the alien night outside continued its passage into day. Far from quelling their thirst for discovery, the revelation on Arz had inflamed a fever of curiosity and resolve—a drive to continue exploring, learning, unraveling the cosmic mysteries, one world at a time.

Ending 3: As the scouter glided back toward the _Marco Four_, the early sun cast long shadows on the ocean, and the last echoes of the morning's chaos slowly faded behind them. Farrell was regaining more control over his limbs, though every movement was still an effort. He took deep breaths, trying to clear his head and piece together what had just happened.

"What do you mean, under water?" Farrell asked, focusing on Gibson's steady hands as they expertly maneuvered the scouter.

"The city isn't built for surface dwellers," Gibson explained. "Those pink natives and the octopods—they're part of the same species. It's an evolutionary split. Above water, they're limited, but under the surface, they become something else entirely. The city is their shared domain."

Farrell absorbed this revelation with growing amazement. "So the islet isn't some sacrificial altar? It's a meeting point—a transition between their two states."

"Exactly," Gibson said. "I've been observing their patterns. Each day, two of them cross over to experience the other form. What we mistook for suicide is a cycle of transformation. The octopods bring the fishers back to shore once they've spent time in their aquatic form. It all fits if you look at the islet as a bridge, not a grave."

They reached the _Marco_, and Gibson landed the scouter smoothly on the sandy beach. Farrell struggled to his feet, wincing at the tingling pain in his muscles, and they climbed out together. Stryker was just stumbling out of the port, rubbing his eyes and looking bewildered.

"What's going on? Gibson, Farrell—what happened?" Stryker asked, an edge of fear in his voice.

"Gib found his city," Farrell replied, managing a grin despite his fatigue. "And we've got to change our reports. It's not a simple native society we're dealing with here. The Arzians have a civilization, but it's nothing like what we imagined."

Gibson quickly outlined his findings to Stryker, whose expression shifted from skepticism to understanding as the story unfolded. The narrative was a jigsaw that, once completed, depicted a complex interdependence between land and sea—a culture that harnessed both to live in harmony with its environment.

"That's incredible," Stryker admitted, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. "It also means Terran colonization would be more than just impractical—it would be disruptive to a unique ecosystem and way of life."

Farrell nodded. "The Arzians have adapted beautifully to their world. Our presence could throw it all off balance. We're not just dealing with a civilization, but with something that's integrated into the planet's very processes."

Gibson looked at Farrell and then at Stryker. "I suggest we recommend a preserve status for this planet. The Arzians have much they could teach us about adaptation and co-existence. But they need to remain undisturbed."

Stryker agreed, seeing the merit in Gibson's suggestion. "I'll amend our reports to reflect this. We're explorers, after all, not conquerors. It's our duty to protect what we've found here."

With the decision made, the tension of the morning slowly ebbed away. Farrell leaned against the _Marco_, his eyes scanning the horizon. The sun was fully up now, casting a golden path across the water that shimmered in the fresh breeze. It was a world that had hidden its secrets well, but now those secrets had been revealed in their true light.

"We're heading back soon then?" Farrell asked, feeling at peace with the resolution.

Gibson nodded, looking out at the ocean. "We've learned what we needed to. It's time to let this place alone, let it thrive as it has for centuries."

Stryker smiled at his crew, pride evident in his worn but happy face. "We've done well here, better than I could have hoped. Let's pack up, file our reports, and let the galaxy know what belongs only to Arz."

They stood for a moment, silent in the shared understanding of their roles as caretakers of something much larger than themselves. Then, with purpose renewed, they turned toward the ship, ready to complete their task and leave the world they had come to respect untouched, its mysteries left for its inhabitants alone to ponder and cherish.

Ending 4: Farrell sat in the cockpit of the scouter, tingling sensations rippling through his limbs as sensation gradually returned. The vast, gleaming sea stretched below, a serene blue blanket undisturbed by the chaos that had narrowly unfolded. The adrenaline still coursed through him, a bizarre mix of fear and the lingering hangover of discovery.

He glanced at Gibson, who was steering the scouter back to the _Marco_ with practiced ease. Despite the nonchalance in Gibson's demeanor, there was a sharp intensity to his eyes—a gleam of vindication. Farrell followed his gaze, scanning the now distant islet, feeling an undercurrent of awe at Gibson’s earlier words: the lost city, under water.

"You found it," Farrell repeated numbly, clinging to the words like a talisman against his recent brush with death.

Gibson nodded, his lips curving into a slight smile, the triumph subtly infectious, washing over the fatigue etched on his features. "Yes, and it's magnificent. It's unlike anything we've ever imagined—the scale, the architecture, the intricacy. What's more, Arthur, it’s not just an empty relic. It’s still alive in its own way, functioning. I don't fully understand it yet, but it’s as if the entire ocean is a part of it."

Farrell listened, trying to fit this revelation into everything he knew. The creatures of the sea, the strange compulsions of the Arzians—suddenly, pieces began to fall into place. "The fishers aren’t just sacrifices to those creatures," he said slowly. "They’re an integral part—ritualistic, perhaps? Sustenance or… a form of communication?"

Gibson dimmed the scouter's engines to a gentle hum as they approached the silvery hull of the _Marco Four_. The vessel stood stark against the verdant backdrop of Arz, a symbol of their foreign intrusion into this ancient dance between species. He carefully maneuvered the scouter into its berth, then turned to Farrell with an expression caught between scholarly excitement and something far deeper, almost reverent.

"You've hit upon it, Arthur. The Arzians, or at least their ancestors, were the creators of this city—they live now alongside their creations. Perhaps they’ve forgotten why, but the tradition endures." He paused then added thoughtfully, "Our presence here upsets that balance. That’s why it’s crucial we conduct ourselves cautiously."

Farrell hesitated as they stepped out onto the ship’s platform, the cool metal underfoot grounding him in this critical juncture. "Then what’s to be done? If this world is meant to be a new home for Terrans, do we alter their way of life, their very existence, to suit ours?"

Gibson’s response came with quiet conviction. "It’s a matter of respect, Arthur. We study, we understand—perhaps we even find a method to coexist. But first, we must know them truly, without fear or prejudice. The city, the cycle—they’re a legacy of a comprehension far beyond our current reach. There’s beauty in that, a potential ally, if approached rightly."

Once inside the vessel, Stryker was waiting for them, rubbing sleep from his eyes, looking sheepishly apologetic. "Gibson, Farrell—I’m sorry. If I hadn’t dosed myself, I’d have—"

Farrell waved off the apology with a weary hand, still buoyed by Gibson’s enthusiasm. "You’ve nothing to be sorry for, Lee. Just wish you’d trusted Gib’s hunch before."

Stryker managed a weary grin. "I’m the stubborn one, I see now."

Gibson, ever pragmatic, pushed forward with urgency. "There’s much to be done. We’ve barely scratched the surface of understanding here. The city—I need to get back down there, and I could use any help you’re willing to give."

Stryker nodded, his expression sobering. "We’re with you, Gib. We’ll coordinate with Terra for a more extended study. There’s an entire heritage beneath those waves that might unlock doors we haven’t dreamed of yet."

The decision was silently unanimous between them. With a shared look, a synchronous understanding passed—of duty, of respect for another consciousness woven into the fabric of this world, and an unyielding drive to learn, explore, and preserve.

As the sun climbed over the alien horizon, the ship’s crew was already involved in preparations for the next expedition, a blend of human determination and hopeful anticipation suspended among the stars.

Farrell stood for a moment more, looking back toward where the ocean met the sky, veiling its mysteries in shimmering secrecy. They were foreigners here, yet there was a kinship to this boundless frontier, shared through the pursuit of understanding and the unity it would forge.

In preparing to uncover the hidden city once more, the explorers readied their minds to write a new chapter, uniting Arz’s enigmatic history with the burgeoning lineage of humanity's own celestial journey.

Ending 5: Farrell rubbed feeling back into his limbs as he eased himself upright in the scouter's seat. The landscape tore past beneath them, blurring into the indistinct mosaic of greens and browns. The air was warm and electric with life, a deceptive tranquility contrasted against the furious encounter they'd just escaped.

"Underwater?" murmured Farrell, still trying to piece together the enigma they'd stumbled upon. "But, how—"

"Their city,” Gibson interjected, his voice a blend of excitement and reprimand, “is a complex made of massive coral structures. It’s like an organic labyrinth down there. I couldn’t see it from above until I began noticing little things—how the squids always came from the same direction, how they’d disappear beneath the waves after every attack."

Farrell nodded, starting to understand. "So, the Arzians aren't just quick meals or playthings for the squids and the lizards. They're somehow... connected?"

Gibson didn't reply immediately. The scouter was skimming the tops of the ocean waves now, leaving behind plumes of mist that vanished in their wake. Farrell watched him navigate with a calm precision that belied his earlier excitement.

"They’re part of the same ecology," Gibson finally said. "An intricate balance. The flying lizards and squids, and those pink fishers—they all tie back to the submerged city. Something down there controls or influences them. It's not just survival, it's symbiosis."

Farrell recalled the nightmarish stillness, the paralysis, and the way the octopods had gently carried the Arzian native back to shore. There was intelligence in their movements, purpose in their actions that went beyond primitive instinct. "But how does it all fit together? The suicides, the presence on that cursed islet, the city... what are they guarding, or serving?"

A slow smile crept on Gibson's face. "That's the trick of it, isn't it? We've spent so long thinking of them as separate from the environment. But what if the city wasn't built by them or us? What if it's alive?"

Farrell stared at him, dumbfounded. "Alive?"

"Think about it. Arz has been noted for its unique biosphere. What if what we see above—the lizards, the squids, and all these elaborate rituals—are merely external expressions of something much more profound? I don't think they built the city. I think they serve something greater, something their minds and bodies evolved around," Gibson explained, his enthusiasm infectious. "We stumbled upon one of the universe’s rarities: a living city."

Farrell sank back into silence, envisioning Gibson's hypothesis as a grand puzzle, sensing the dizzying gaps and flashing insights that begged incredulity. It was fantastic but resonated with an unearthly logic, fitting nature's miraculous complexity.

They skimmed over the wave tips, the land's rapidly closing contours approaching clarity as the scouter reached the Marco’s position. Stryker awaited them, renewed worry and relief etched in his every feature, his earlier drowsiness long forgotten upon seeing Farrell's return.

"It was touch and go when I finally woke up," he confessed, grabbing hold of Farrell's arm when he alighted from the craft. "Arthur... you—"

Farrell patted Stryker's shoulder. "You dosed yourself good last night. I had a chat with Ghibli when I needed you, but here I am—no worse the wear."

Gibson stepped forward briskly. "Lee, let me show you what we've discovered."

Over the next several hours, the trio deliberated over charts, compared data, and filled in blanks as Gibson synthesised their collected insights with his own, his excitement washing away caution and fatigue.

By the time sunlight arched to its zenith, the invisible strands of their alien discovery pulled a coherent picture closer to tangible reality. The planet Arz, a potential home, guarded an ancient secret—a sentient construct, a city alive, exerting its unseen authority over an entwined ecosystem.

Their mission on Arz no longer seemed a mere routine exploration for Earth’s colonisation. Its value lay deeper—an introduction to life forms that expanded the very definitions of cities, inhabitants, and histories.

"Arz can still be a perfect world for humans," Gibson ventured cautiously, "but we would need to weave ourselves carefully into this unseen tapestry, understanding rather than altering the equilibrium."

Farrell broke into a smile, drawn as much by the adventure as by the implicit challenge. "Well, isn’t that precisely what Earthship Marco Four was built for: to find the strange, the extraordinary… to find new homes?"

Stryker nodded, a wry chuckle escaping. "If home is more tangled with alien squids, man-eating lizards, and unparalleled mysteries than we thought, maybe we've done more than just find it. Maybe we've earned understanding—and in doing so, received guardianship of something unimaginably rare."

Even as the day waned, a shared commitment settled between them. Together, they'd ensure the story of Arz remained untangled—sharp, alive, and eternally unfolding.

In more ways than the Marco Four's logs could capture, they'd soared high above mere explorers’ expectations, landing as unlikely stewards of a secret legacy. Theirs was the discovery of a living mystery, the cradle of a city that earthbound astronomers might never have imagined, built not from stone, but the cascading lineages of life itself.
