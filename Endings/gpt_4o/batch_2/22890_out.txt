Ending 1: The days following the demonstration with van Manderpootz drifted by in a haze of regret and haunting memories. I couldn’t shake the image of Joanna, radiant and laughing, then pale and unconscious in the grip of a nightmarish reality. Her memory lingered, a bittersweet reminder of what could have been.

Work at the office offered little solace. My father surrounded me with his usual strict expectations, but even his grumbling faded into the background noise of my troubled thoughts. I was engulfed in the realization that every day was an unfolding sequence of moments each as fragile and unpredictable as the last. It dawned on me that I wasn’t just battling a tendency for tardiness; I was grappling with time and chance, forces as elusive as the shifting worlds of “if.”

As the weeks passed, an inexplicable yearning grew within me. I needed to return to the subjunctivisor, to seek answers in the might-have-beens. But logic choked out every reckless inclination. There was no changing the past—only living with the echoes it left behind. Nevertheless, the desire to explore those untrodden paths persisted, nagging at the edges of my consciousness. 

One evening, I found myself in the vicinity of the Physics Building. Without making a conscious decision, I found my feet treading a familiar path toward van Manderpootz's laboratory. The sky threatened rain, a dark curtain of clouds looming ominously above, and the air smelled of impending storms. I hesitated at the entrance, debating whether or not to disturb the great inventor with such a frivolous request. 

But van Manderpootz wasn't one to ignore chance encounters, or perhaps he’d seen my approach from a window. Just as I turned to leave, his booming voice filled the corridor: "Dixon! What wind blows you here?" 

Caught, I turned back, a sheepish grin tugging at my lips despite myself. There he stood, every bit as colossally confident as ever, his stature emphasized by the faint light of his laboratory spilling into the hallway. 

"Or is it perhaps destiny?" he continued, eyes twinkling beneath formidable brows. "I've always said that one doesn’t merely stumble upon the abode of van Manderpootz.”

I managed a smile, struck anew by the eccentricity and brilliance that characterized this man. "You could say that curiosity has gotten the better of me, Professor," I replied, stepping into the room where so many untold possibilities lay encased in cold steel and refractive glass.

He gestured grandly to a seat, a mix of impatience and amusement quirking his lips. "Sit, sit! What curiosity do you bring me tonight? Another jaunt through the subjunctivisor? Or have you—like a true visionary—also seen its end?"

His words nudged open the door to thoughts I’d tried to suppress. "No, Professor. Actually... it’s something broader. I've come to realize how intricately possibility intertwines with our lives. And yet, it doesn’t ease the pain of loss or regret."

Van Manderpootz's expression grew momentarily grave. "Ah, Dixon, you speak of the human condition! But remember, it is precisely this uncertainty that shapes our journey in life. Were it not for the unknown, for time's unpredictable unfolding, there'd be little to strive toward."

I nodded, understanding that these musings were no less important than inventions or gadgets. "Still, there's a part of me that wonders what life looms beyond certainty. What version of me would lie there, untouched by tragedy."

"Then,” van Manderpootz said quietly, "perchance it is not the subjunctivisor that interests you—it is understanding, acceptance. This is something machines can never impart. Only time."

We lapsed into silence, the hiss of rain beginning to tap against the laboratory windows. The subjunctivisor stood forgotten between us, an apparatus of destiny's shadow, waiting for new tales of "if."

In that quiet moment with van Manderpootz, wisdom took root in me, bringing with it a soft, unyielding resolve. I left the lab that night not with an answer to the past but with a humble commitment: to meet time with courage, to let questions linger unanswered, and to find strength in the journey itself.

As I walked home through the rain-sweetened streets, I felt the shift within—a new willingness to embrace uncertainty, even a hint of readiness to see what lay ahead, Joanna’s memory a part of me, an indelible silver thread woven through the tapestry of my life.

Ending 2: The memory of that evening lingered with me like a haunting shadow, its eerie presence casting a pall over the days and nights that followed. The knowledge of what might have been, of the fate that almost claimed me, loomed large in my thoughts. It was with reluctance that I returned to my routine, the mundane affairs of the office and the half-hearted attempts at social engagements failing to distract me from the specter of Joanna Caldwell's face and the imagined warmth of her presence beside me.

Days turned to weeks, and the unease settled into a dull melancholy. Yet amid the drone of daily life, van Manderpootz's invention had instilled in me an unsettling yet profound awareness of the rogue twine of fate, particularly the peculiar kinship between time and circumstance. For once in my life, I carefully watched the hands of the clock, acutely aware of the weight each moment carried. I often found my mind drifting back to that fateful alternate world painted by the subjunctivisor—a world where I had met her, where our destinies might have danced together, perhaps only to be swallowed by the depths.

One afternoon, as autumn brushed the air with a crisp chill and painted the city in hues of amber, I found myself straying from the office, caught in an unnamed restlessness. My feet, imbued with their own purpose, led me to a small café nestled against the hustle of Manhattan. The place was inconspicuous, a humble retreat with arched windows that spilled the glow of golden warmth across the cobbled pavement.

Inside, I was greeted by a comforting fragrance of roasted beans and the gentle hum of muted conversations. I idly scanned the room, my eyes drifting from face to face, and it was then that I saw her. Joanna, seated by the window, her attention absorbed by a sketchbook, her silver-blue eyes reflecting the soft light filtering through the glass. It was as if time hiccuped, the world pausing for a brief eternity, and then released its breath in a sigh around me.

My heart raced, every fiber of my being urging me forward until I stood beside her table. Nervously, almost treading on the edge of a forgotten dream, I cleared my throat. "Joanna?"

Her gaze lifted, and in an instant, recognition bloomed in her eyes, warm and immediate. "Dick!" she exclaimed with delightful surprise, her smile unfurling like a blossom in morning sun. "What in the world are you doing here?"

"I—" My words faltered, and I laughed softly at the absurdity of the moment. "I seem to have been late again," I said, feeling the knots of past regret loosening. "Care if I join you?"

"Please do," she replied warmly, motioning to the seat across from her.

I sat, the weight of all the imagined worlds falling away as we exchanged pleasantries, verging into familiar roles once more. It was so easy, falling into conversation as if we had known each other lifetimes, not lifetimes apart. We talked of her art, the illustrations she had been working on, and her hopes of traveling to Paris. It turned out, she hadn't sailed yet; life had interrupted, with plans for Paris postponed but not forgotten.

"How strange," she mused, a thoughtful look contouring her features. "You know, I was supposed to be on that ill-fated flight from New York a few weeks back, the one heading over the Atlantic. But circumstances changed last moment."

I nodded, awestruck by the peculiar dance of fate, grateful I did not share my own encounter with that tragedy. "It's strange how life's timing can nudge us different ways," I offered, feeling the pull of something profound in our reunion.

"Indeed," she agreed, her eyes meeting mine, a flicker of understanding passing between us, as if we both sensed the chapters of a story being rewritten in real time. The haunting reach of alternate possibilities had dissolved into simplicity, a willing embrace of the serendipity that brought adventure or mishap with equal aplomb.

Our conversation drifted into a comfortable place, lacking the insistence of urgency that might define those seeking to recapture lost time. Here and now was perfect; we lingered without the fear of loss, savoring each glimmer of smiles returned and shared warmth.

As twilight descended, casting the world in a gentle blanket, I extended an invitation. "How about a stroll?" I suggested, inspired by the content tranquility of the moment. "Paris can wait, but tonight's too perfect to rush off without exploring it further."

Joanna laughed, the sound a melody that settled in my soul. "I'd love that," she said, coloring the evening with expectation and promise.

And so, together, we stepped into the cool night, leaving worries of alternate worlds behind. We meandered through the streets, beneath the glow of lamplight, entangled in a present moment that held no hidden sorrows, only shared joys. With each step, I cast backward glances at the might-have-beens, now merely shadows juxtaposed against the blaze of a new chapter unfolding—a future rendered from choice and chance, and tempered by the priceless realization that in some inherent manner, just being here, just being now, was its own form of salvation.

Ending 3: Days went by, but the haunting images from the subjunctivisor's simulation lingered. I saw Joanna's silver-blue eyes, now forever imprinted in my mind, and agonized over the thought that I might have shared responsibility in a doomed world. The decision to use the subjunctivisor weighed heavily on me, but at the same time, it brought a strange sense of closure. I knew, as well as one can know something so ephemeral, that even in the realm of "if," I had found something tragically real.

Yet knowing wasn't exactly alleviating. It was a comfort in the sense of resolving ambiguity, but it was a new form of burden. I couldn't shake the feeling of disconnection from my own life, as if the shadows of that other world leaked into my reality. Every tick of the clock in my office was a reminder of the notion of being too late, and yet not late enough.

My father noticed the change, a shadow of worry passing through his usually stern demeanor. "Something bothering you, Dixon?" he asked over breakfast one morning, hiding concern under the guise of casual inquiry.

I hesitated. Sharing meant confronting the unspeakable enormities of what van Manderpootz's device had shown me.

"Nothing that time won't fix," I said finally, though the words were hollow, even to my ears.

The days turned to weeks, and the brutal reality slowly began to dilute, like ink in water. I returned to work, resumed my social engagements, and fell back into the familiar rhythms of a life that now felt slightly alien. It took conscious effort, but with deliberate distraction, I participated in meetings, calls, and occasional frivolous escapades that defined my prior existence.

Yet, amidst this forced normalcy, an unshakable longing persisted. Joanna's haunting presence lingered at the periphery of my consciousness, refusing to fade into obscurity. Her vivid image remained, a beautiful specter in the shadowed recesses of my mind.

Then something unexpected happened on the day the company jet finally set course toward Moscow. Secretary Maxwell, the only one aware of my postponed trip, had checked and cleared the logistics weeks ago, but it happened during a conversation with an elderly passenger beside me. Curious about my excessive grasp on his pre-flight prayers, I asked, "Superstitious?"

He chuckled, snow-tufted brows raised in mock offense. "Grounded on pragmatism, I assure you. In my day, I was an aeronautical engineer—a cautious one," he added with a grin. "I contributed to the Baikal's design, actually. Solid build. Shame about what happened. May they rest in peace."

I swallowed against a sudden rush of emotion. "A tragic day."

His eyes held mine. "But every 'what if' inevitably leads, doesn't it? Fear and regret become layers we've the blessed ability to shed, if we choose the strength."

His words stirred something deep within me. Layers, and the choice to molt them. It rang with a timeless clarity that silenced the tumult within. For the first time, thoughts of Joanna became a tribute rather than a wound—a reminder of transient beauty, a glimpse of eternal possibilities.

Changed but resolute, I arrived in Moscow with a lighter spirit. Walking through Red Square, I thought of Joanna with warmth, acknowledging the joy she had represented in the fleeting encounter. The past days' spectral gloom began to dissipate under Moscow's brisk, chilly air.

Some nights later, as I strolled in the Parisian boulevards en route to a meeting, I felt a flicker of contentment thinking this is the city she adored, where her dreams would meet creation. Perhaps one day later, amidst Paris's meandering cobbled streets, an unexpected reunion might kindle.

It was then the glint of silver-blue caught my eye in the crowd, more an impression than a truth. My heart skipped involuntarily, driven by hope rather than certainty.

And somehow, as if the universe conspired with van Manderpootz's machines of impossibility, I felt the world snap into place—when Joanna, or someone like her, or any of the myriad potentials she'd represented, laughed alongside another ‘if’—tethering each possibility with one unifying certainty: that even amidst the infinite scope of maybe, now was where we lived and chose to love.

"Late again, Dixon!" I imagined her voice, light yet earnest, as I turned to enter the meeting. But no heavier weight clung this time. Time would stand still only for those who dared pause it with worry.

I smiled back at what could have been and released it without regret, stepping within the circle of present's limitless might.

Ending 4: The visit to van Manderpootz's lab had stirred insights I wasn't fully prepared to grapple with alone. Watching my own hypothetical demise, clutching Joanna as water surged in, had left a haunting chill that refused to loosen its grip even now as I reclined in the comfort of my study at home. The subdued glow of the city lights filtering through the window offered little warmth.

I couldn't shake the feeling that I wasn't far removed from the dimensions of "if," as van Manderpootz would put it. Certainly, I was alive and unscathed, spared the actual calamity. Yet, in another dimension, another world of 'if,' I existed no longer—or rather, never escaped that plunge. It was unsettling in a way that was both weighty with unrealized tragedy and strangely exhilarating for the vibrancy of life renewed. When I woke the next day, decisively in my own world, the morning felt fresh, the air tasted just that much sweeter.

But something else persisted—a lingering sensation of unsatisfied emotion. I couldn't dismiss my thoughts about Joanna, though she was only a figment of that unreal journey. How does one reconcile affection for an entity from an alternative, non-existent reality? Yet, the clarity of her image was underpinned by the memory of silvery eyes and gleeful intelligence. If there was any purpose I could cling to from that alternate nightmare, it might be in honoring the spirit of Joanna—a newfound urgency, a drive to live with intention rather than drift with indifference.

With resolve, I rose earlier than usual that week, maneuvering with uncharacteristic punctuality. My father watched wordlessly as I entered the office each morning at the stroke of nine, a silent acknowledgment passing between us. If I were to earn any epithet besides "late," I preferred it be "changed."

Then there was Paris—the thought of actually meeting Joanna in this plane still kindled dreams of possibility. I still had that trip slated for Moscow and nothing prevented me from adjusting my itinerary. After all, the real Moscow, unlike its nightmarish facsimile, still lay patiently in my living future rather than receding irretrievably into the past.

So I tilted my fortune, swayed by desires begot between "what is" and "what might be." I reserved a flight to Moscow with a layover in Paris that, initially insignificant in my designs, burgeoned into the prime inspiration for the journey.

The aircraft soared towards the French city with nary a hint of terror, present only to linger in the back quarters of memory. As we descended, anticipation electrified the mundane act of transferring. Beneath the Parisian sky, a vibrant canopy of sights and sounds, I was unexpectedly buoyed by conviction.

An address reached in moments, breath caught in eager thoughts, led me to a small gallery near the Seine. Inside, chronologies took a pause, leaving colors to express epochs and skies—a different sense of time, as an artist might render it. Those same silvery eyes, unmistakably hers, flickered with startled recognition as they caught mine across entranceways and intervening curiosities.

"Joanna," I voiced, the name resonating more real than all my musings. Her face widened into a warm, if quizzical, smile.

"Dick!" she exclaimed almost instinctively—ironic perfection born from illusion. Nothing needed explaining. We both seemed to understand, eyes speaking where language might falter. The unreality turned real expressed not in obsessive reliance on what might have been, but in the weight of present living.

We laughed, talked, and shared stories amid canvases and paintwork. When at last I told of my forthcoming journey, it was with assurance that on my return, I needn't rely on subjunctive magics to find her.

And seated on the plane bound finally for Moscow, knowing the sun would break tomorrow without entanglements or delays, I had a sense of owning my hours, of mastering, at least within a world unburdened by paradox, this new grasp of time and self.

For in those branching worlds lay not just tragedy, but also possibility beyond specters of regret and time lost. Joanna's laughter may have begun as an echo from a vanishing mist, yet it found permanence cast by the sun-drenched streets of Paris, joining the realm of tangible moments ahead—etched now into the living fiber of time's narrow, persistent thread.

Ending 5: I lay awake for hours that night, the images from the subjunctivisor replaying over and over in my mind. Joanna's face surfaced with every attempt at sleep, her silver-blue eyes wide in fear before the inevitable crash. I had believed the subjunctivisor might ease my doubts, that knowing the truth of what could have been would bring peace. Yet now I knew—my tardiness might have spared my life, but at the cost of something infinitely more precious.

As dawn broke, casting its light across the city and into my room, I realized there was no reversing time, no turning back the clock. The worlds of 'if' were mere reflections in a fading mirror. It was my own world I had to confront, my actual time and place I had to inhabit. And it seemed suddenly urgent and vital to change the shape of it.

I needed to speak with van Manderpootz once more. I needed to express how much his invention had meant to me and to ascertain if his autobiography required any assistance in publishing. But if I were honest with myself, it was an excuse to immerse myself back into something real and present, something outside of the labyrinthine corridors of my own mind.

Yet the path from intention to action stretched interminably. The days slipped away, each one marked by hesitation, by the ritualistic fervor of telling myself “tomorrow.” But tomorrow never came of its own accord; a summons was necessary. In the end, it was a letter—an unexpected delivery from a law firm in Moscow—that stirred me from my torpor.

It seemed preposterous at first glance, the notion that a young artist with eyes like silver might have left anything to me, a fleeting acquaintance. But the letter was clear and explicit.

Dear Mr. Wells,

Our offices represent the estate of Miss Joanna Caldwell. In reviewing her possessions, we discovered a letter addressed to Dixon Wells, care of the N.J. Wells Corporation. Miss Caldwell requested it be delivered in the event of her untimely passing.

Enclosed and with deepest sympathies,

Sergov & Partners

For long moments I stared at the envelope, fingers reluctant to disturb the careful seal. Then slowly, as if performing a sacred rite, I revealed the note within.

Dear Dick,

It seems silly, perhaps, writing to you like this. I hope we have met in person again, perhaps even shared new adventures. But if you are reading this, something must have gone unplanned, a piece of fate’s jigsaw misaligned.

Our meeting on the _Baikal_ remains a singular day; one of unexpected joy in what has been a straightforward life. Your kindness made the trip to Paris so much more than it meant to be—a leap not just over oceans, but into a shared human tapestry, richer than I imagined.

I doubt you believe this about yourself, but to me, you brought time to life—to the present—when our paths crossed among those ephemeral hours. I made it here and have begun to paint, inspired as much by our conversation as by the heartlands of Montparnasse.

Just know you mattered in ways you perhaps didn’t realize. Stay as you are but be more than you believe possible. Promise me you won’t let time slip through your grasp; weave it into your hopes and dreams.

Warmest regards,  
Joanna

I held the letter to my heart, feeling its warmth dispel the icy hand of guilt. Joanna had believed in me, had left me something more valuable than moments lost to the subjunctivisor—a strange but treasured legacy that demanded honoring.

There was more than one way to chase specters of possibility. I resolved to live a life that Joanna would recognize and approve; proposing that good intention not only honor the memory of kindness shared but seed new futures where regret held no dominion.

With new purpose, and perhaps for the first time entirely on time, I placed a call that morning to van Manderpootz. The past was already another 'if'; now I had a present to reconstruct, an autobiography of my own to write—one where fleeting comets of possibilities danced around the steady star of reality.

Van Manderpootz answered, predictably in the midst of some potent declaration or another. “Ah, Dixon! You’re prompt for once. An intriguing shift in your temporal awareness indeed.”

I smiled into the receiver, gaze cast towards the morning sky. “It seems even I, professor, am capable of change.”
