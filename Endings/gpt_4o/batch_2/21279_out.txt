Ending 1: The painter, lost in the echoes of the shots, considered the tableau below him. The blood on the floor, pooling around Wehling, Dr. Hitz, and Leora Duncan, seemed like a bold, visceral addition to his mural—a hidden truth that the sterile, idyllic garden could never capture. He continued to stare, heavy with contemplation, as if waiting for the scene to speak further truths.

A quiet settled in as the impromptu silence of death echoed through the excessively clean halls of the hospital. Time stretched like a canvas that the painter himself wished to reach down and paint over, to correct, to highlight, to let the story of life spill messily in its realism.

The door swung open and another orderly entered. He was immediately stopped by the sight before him. His wide eyes darted from the fallen figures to the blood patterning itself across the floor, then up to the painter, who looked down somberly.

"What happened here?" the orderly asked, his voice a whisper almost lost amidst the endless white.

The painter shrugged, a gesture heavy with the world-weariness of a man who’d witnessed too much. "Life happened," he answered simply. 

The orderly shook his head, bemusement fighting with the duties of protocol. He reached for a console on the wall, hitting a button that sent an alarm quietly whispering its way through the rest of the hospital, summoning the proper authorities who would label and tidy up this unwelcome deviation.

Turning back to the painter, the orderly gingerly picked his way around the bodies. "They're supposed to live in that portrait forever, and yet..." His words trailed off, as though searching for meaning in the still, quiet figures before him.

The painter sighed, shuffled to reposition himself on the ladder. "What's forever?" he muttered. "Brush strokes and chemical reactions—humans frozen in time for as long as we see fit? Real life won’t be ignored no matter how we choose to frame it on a wall."

The orderly glanced back at his colleague's slightly mocking face on the mural and studied the painter again. "Are you always this philosophical about everything—or just death?" His attempt at levity fell flat, brittle in the air as it was.

The painter chuckled dryly. "Death and art, they're the only things that will command everyone’s attention eventually, some sooner than others."

More footsteps came, official ones, clad in bureaucratic authority, followed by the Service Division, along with more staff to manage the situation. They studied the bodies, the pooling lifeblood, the hopelessness palpable even in tragedy.

A nurse whispered to herself. "Three more today, marked down for balance."

Balance. That idea, so sterile, so void of the true chaos and art of living. The painter looked again at the mural—faces both finished and untouched, starkly indifferent to what had transpired.

As they began removing the bodies, the painter climbed down from his ladder, leaving his work unfinished. He walked over to the open window that looked out onto perfectly manicured gardens surrounding the hospital—a curated representation of life that played too well into the dream they wanted to sell the world.

He heard someone behind him, one of the men in charge, speaking in low tones—authoritative, detached. The official had glanced at the mural approvingly despite everything. "The garden looks good. Quite like an invitation to serenity, don't you think?"

The painter turned toward the voice, staring past him at the unfinished work. "It looks like what you want people to believe," he countered softly. "But you'll never find truth if you refuse to look beyond the frame."

With that, leaving the spoken thoughts floating in the sterile air, the painter stepped out into the open collider that was the rest of the world. He moved like a man with no further attachment—on to the next canvas, perhaps hoping to find a place where truths were told in his brushstrokes, where life’s untidiness wasn't just framed for decor, but seen and understood for the chaos and raw beauty it was.

Life, too vivid to be ignored.

With steps that echoed like gunshots through the quiet hospital corridors, he disappeared down the sterile hallway, leaving behind the people who remained, bounding breathlessly between life and death in that immaculate theater they all played a part in, none acknowledging the glaring truth just outside their own chosen frames.

And as the cruiser carrying the dead rolled silently away, the hospital hummed back into life—a flawless system—obliviously spinning on, a surrogate for truth with each calculated breath it took.

Ending 2: The mural, half-finished with its empty faces and idealized figures, loomed like a mockery of perfection over the tragic tableau below. The painter remained seated on his ladder, a silent observer of the grim spectacle, lost in contemplation. For what seemed like an eternity, he was a stone effigy in an absurdly vibrant gallery of life and death.

The quiet that followed the gunshots was profound, as though the very air was holding its breath, unsure how to proceed after such violent conclusions. It was a silence that insisted on reflection. The painter looked at the revolver still clutched in Wehling's lifeless hand, its purpose so agonizingly clear now. More than a weapon, it was Wehling's final declaration against an indifferent universe.

A door creaked open, tearing the veil of silence. The orderly had returned, his cheerful whistle halted abruptly at the scene before him. His eyes darted from body to body, and slowly widened with a dawning comprehension mingled with horror. And yet, his training as a staff must have included some manner of preparation for such eventualities, for he summoned the stoicism needed.

"Well," he said at last, with a tone void of any real emotion, "looks like there's been quite the shuffle while I was gone."

The painter descended from his perch, stepping gingerly around the pool of spreading red that seemed to vie with the paint spills for dominance over the sterile floor. He felt the orderly’s gaze, more expectant than questioning.

"You never really get used to it, do you?" said the painter absently.

The orderly shrugged, nursing the distant air of one who dealt in routine denial. "Still, shouldn’t take long for replacements to come. Always someone ready, you know."

The painter nodded, more to himself than to anyone else. The words hung in the air like an inevitable truth—a new set of people, a new series of faces to be painted and filled on the wall, a new set of lives and deaths held in precarious balance by the system they'd built. Bureaucracy, numbers, the cold comfort of rules.

He scanned the room, fixing his gaze finally on the mural, its faceless figures staring back blankly—an atmosphere eerily reminiscent of a destiny unfulfilled. There was a girl carrying a sheaf, a worker sawing a branch, a figure without a head still to be claimed. Silent, bland caricatures.

Turning to the orderly, the painter asked, "Will they care, do you think, those who take their places?"

The orderly looked bemused. "Care about what, old man?"

"That they're just bodies, functioning, replacing, maintaining the count," the painter replied with a sigh.

"People care about what they can see right in front of them. Anything else... well, they don't think too much on it. Makes it easier." The orderly's gaze fell again upon the motionless figures on the floor, an odd hint of pity in his voice. "Poor souls."

The painter fell silent, the randomness of the fate that had visited these three lost souls playing through his mind. Here was Wehling, a man forced to make the impossible choice, whose solution had been as permanent as it had been painful. A mother in purple who an instant before had been secure in her role, a man of prestige felled in an instant of desperate revolt. Each of them had walked their own brief, vivid path to this place, to this moment.

Perhaps it needed a painter to reflect on the irony or the tragedy. Society had given him the job of immortalizing faces, but the souls attached to those faces avoided immortality with alarming regularity.

The orderly checked his watch, made a quick call on his communicator. "We'll have someone out shortly," he informed. "Paperwork, too."

"Efficient of you," murmured the painter.

The mural awaited his attention. He picked up his brush, touching it dismissively into the paint. Yet now, for the first time, the task seemed as poignant as it was essential, a mustering of meaning against the void. The faceless woman with the sheaves would remain blank just a little longer. Somehow, it seemed fitting—until the paint dried, the wall had room enough for thoughts and memories.

He gazed for a moment longer at Wehling, Duncan, and Hitz, a trio briefly united by necessity, then so suddenly, permanently, joined in oblivion. There was no judgment on his face—merely acceptance of the world for what it was and what it wasn't.

A fresh figure in the mural: faceless, lifeless, yet somehow teeming with possibility—even if that possibility was yet another iteration of the same story, another life woven into the tapestry of the living and the dead.

As he returned to his ladder, the painter reflected that creation, like destruction, was a ceaseless cycle. What mattered was finding a place to stand amid its relentless spin, a place to leave a mark more permanent than mere paint.

The mural awaited him. He picked up his brush with newfound resolve—a small defiance against the inevitable turning of the wheel.

Ending 3: The painter climbed down from his ladder, wiping his hands on his smock. He moved cautiously, almost reverently, between the bodies. They lay there, caught in a moment of decision that now seemed eternal and weightless in the silent room.

He wandered over to where Wehling's body lay and paused, looking at the revolver, then at Wehling's face. There was a peace there now, a resolution that wasn't present mere moments before. He wasn't sure whether to call it tragic or senseless—a word any more meaningful than the blank stares of the freshly departed.

In the quiet aftermath, the painter heard the distant noise of new life: muffled cries of the newborn from the maternity ward. A cycle, ever-unbroken. Life persisted, even in a world where it was as easily extinguished as a flickering candle. He mused on the irony of his work: painting images of vitality and abundance while living in a society that put such strict limits on both.

Turning away from the remains, the painter retrieved his brush and palette. With a strange sense of duty, he approached the mural, scrutinizing the incomplete faces and bodies that begged completion. For a moment, he hesitated, then decisively dipped his brush into the paint.

His strokes now were softer, hesitant, not the bold and dutiful applications of an artist filling prescribed roles. He painted, but not the expected figures of bureaucrats or doctors. Instead, he allowed his brush to convey something of the moment, something raw and unfiltered. The faceless gained faces, but not of those celebrated by society. They were not famous nor powerful.

On the wall, Leora Duncan appeared anew, not as a snipper or pruner, but as herself, with an expression caught between apprehension and acceptance. Beside her, Dr. Hitz was reborn—not as the man dispensing destiny but as a simple, fallible human being.

The painter's hands worked seemingly of their own accord as the bodies on the mural took life, filled with stories and complexities, each figure becoming a testament to those who lived without glory. He transformed each faceless visage into a visage of untold stories, reflecting the ordinary heroism of choosing inconvenient paths, of living life in an ordered world that asked too little of the heart.

Step by step, he worked through into the morning, the early light filtering into the waiting room, illuminating the mural. It caught on the freshly painted faces, revealing them in their earnestness and vulnerability.

It wasn't until the toll of the morning bustle filled the hallway outside that the painter stepped back, viewing his work in full. The faces—no longer blank, no longer merely placeholders for names of officialdom—now watched over each arrival and departure with a certain empathy.

The painter did not feel pride in his work but a poignant satisfaction, a momentary connection to the truth wrapped in the narratives of each stroke. It was a reframing of life's question—where faces and choices mattered, not because of the roles they filled but because of the lives they lived.

Soon, the stirrings of the hospital would demand attention—a nurse would stumble upon the scene, and alarms would follow. Yet for now, the waiting room remained in sacred stillness, unknowingly attended by a mural that finally said something genuine.

Stepping back to his ladder, the painter folded it up with a creak, gathering his supplies. He spared one more glance at his work, nodding faintly before turning to leave, to slip away unnoticed.

As he approached the exit, he whispered a gentle apology to the vacant room, not for the messiness of recent events but for the illusion of control that had been pulled over the world like a shroud. And yet, there remained a peculiar solace in its unraveling.

The painter pushed through the swinging doors, vanishing into the bustling obscurity of the day, leaving behind a new question on the waiting room wall: To be or not to be?

In a world weighed down with decisions and consequences, perhaps it took an accidental art to remind it that its very existence, with all its flawed humanity, was imperfectly beautiful.

Ending 4: The painter sighed deeply, his gaze fixed on the remnants of an act that captured life’s contradictions so starkly—an act of desperate defiance and ultimate surrender all at once. His brush hung limply from his hand, a forgotten relic of another kind of creation altogether, one less about bringing life and more about capturing it as it slipped away.

For a moment, the waiting room was silent. The figures in the mural stared out with their painted permanence, unchanged and unchangeable against the violent episode that had just unfolded beneath them. The painter looked at the blank faces still waiting to be filled and wondered who they would belong to now that so many futures had been abruptly altered.

The door to the delivery rooms swung open, and a nurse entered, oblivious to the scene before her. "Mr. Wehling? Dr. Hitz wanted me to..." Her voice trailed off as her eyes caught up with her words, fixing on the tableau of still bodies and spreading crimson.

She stood frozen, unsure whether to scream or to turn and flee. It was the painter's calm voice that broke the spell, his tone almost conversational. “I suppose you’ll need to call someone.”

The nurse nodded, still processing, and backed away to the nearest phone. While she did so, the painter climbed down from his stepladder and carefully placed his brush on his palette, surveying the streaks of vibrant color as if searching for some hidden meaning amidst the chaos.

Eventually, people came—orderlies, security personnel, someone from administration, and finally the solemn figures from the Federal Bureau of Termination. They moved with orchestrated efficiency, wrapping the bodies of those who had made their unexpected contributions to population control, taking them away to the place where finalities were dealt with in antiseptic fashion.

The painter remained, unnoticed in the corner, contemplating his mural's eternal Eden. Soon, others would come to repair the shattered glass, to scrub the floor clean, to expunge every trace of the tragedy so life could continue its preordained pattern. Dr. Hitz, Leora Duncan, and Edward Wehling would become footnotes in a system that moved inexorably onward, like a well-oiled machine indifferent to the individual cogs it consumed.

As the room cleared out, the nurse returned with a clipboard, her face a mask of professionalism now. "We’ll need a statement," she said, not unkindly.

The painter nodded. He moved to the nearest blank face on the mural, brushing his fingers over the smooth, waiting canvas. "Such irony," he finally said, his voice low and rough.

"How so?" the nurse asked, taking a step closer, genuinely curious.

"The man who wanted to keep his children alive had to kill, while those of us who claim to sustain life do so by asking for death. It seems we trade one life for another endlessly, like an artist applying paint only to wipe it away and start anew." His eyes, deep and weary, met hers with an understanding born of long observation.

"And yet, here you are," she said, gesturing to his position before the mural.

He turned to face the wall again, with its garden and its people poised in an eternal season of renewal. "Yes, here I am," he agreed quietly. "Capturing eternity, one brush stroke at a time."

Somewhere beyond the hospital walls, life rustled on, indifferent to the tragedies, triumphs, and implacable chains of ethically justified decisions that comprised its rhythm. The mural, however, would remain—a testament to the ideal of order amid nature's chaotic churn. 

The nurse hesitated at the edge of the room, watching him in that deferential silence of someone who senses they are witnessing something profound yet unable to articulate it.

“Do you believe in what this place does?” she asked finally, almost in a whisper.

The painter set down his palette, considering the question with the weight it warranted. “Believe?” he echoed, his gaze returning to the mural, where the figures of Hitz and Duncan awaited their painted counterparts once more. "Belief is a powerful thing. Sometimes it guides us to unforeseen ends."

The nurse nodded, taking this as the answer it was. She stepped back, her task here complete, and left the painter alone with his art, and the echoes of what had transpired.

Once more alone, he picked up his brush, dipped it in a shade of hopeful green, and reached for the nearest of the blank faces. Here he would paint someone new, perhaps a face yet unborn, to watch over the mural as it hung silent witness to the eternal exchange between life and death. It was just a single stroke in the endless cycle of creation and destruction, each life ephemeral, each death a fleeting ending, laid down with the mottled pigments on plaster.

And as the colors took form under the guidance of his steady hand, the painter whispered to the wall, to the room, to no one in particular, “To be or not to be…”

The mural remained silent, pondering the question that had no answer, as the painter continued on.


Ending 5: ---

The orderly came back whistling a tuneless tune, steam rising from the coffee cup he'd just procured from the vending machine down the hall. He made his way back into the waiting room, pushing through the swinging doors nonchalantly. His cheerful demeanor shifted immediately when he saw the bodies sprawled across the floor, the pungent smell of gunpowder still lingering in the air.

For a moment, he stood frozen, and then, with what seemed like practiced ease, he set his coffee down on the nearest table and went to the wall to pull a cord that activated a silent alarm. On cue, distant sirens began to rise and converge from different points within the hospital campus.

The painter, still up on his ladder, watched the scene unfold with a detached interest, as though evaluating an artwork occupying a canvas of chaotic life. He sighed deeply, eyeing the crimson splatters that dripped and pooled into dark, glossy stains on the polished floor tiles, stark against the sterile white surroundings.

“Looks like you’ve got some fresh canvases to clean, Grandpa,” the orderly said to the painter, his voice a mixture of routine indifference and tightness that indicated a struggle to maintain composure. The orderly hesitated, then looked up at the mural where Leora Duncan’s incomplete portrait loomed awkwardly beside a sawn branch in mid-fall, next to the towering visage of Dr. Hitz.

"Shame," the orderly muttered without looking away from the mural, "they'll need someone to fill those spaces now. Might have to repaint the whole thing."

“They can paint it over with whatever illusion suits them,” the painter replied sourly, climbing down from his ladder with deliberate slowness. The ladder groaned beneath his weight as he touched down onto the tile, joints crackling in protest. 

"A damn sight more honest than angelic choirboys harmonizing about all this," he continued, gesturing wide to encompass the mural, the waiting room, the fallen bodies.

As more staff arrived, two attendants approached with an automated stretcher, maneuvering it with the efficiency of much practice. They carefully gathered up the bodies, the warm mechanical hum preceding the quiet efficiency with which they vacated the room of its grim burden.

The painter’s gaze met that of the orderly, their silent exchange communicating the inevitable morbid dance too wearisome to give voice. He turned back to his tools, brushes of all sizes waiting with conditioned patience on a sheet of newspaper stained with myriad hues of bygone tokens of art.

“So, what now?” asked the orderly, hands perched on his hips, trying to retain some semblance of normalcy as others swept in and out, all preoccupied in efficient coordination. The rhythmic murmur of the hospital carried on, oblivious to the tragedy playing out within its bounds.

For a moment, the painter paused before speaking—a thought weighing something unspeakable had taken root. "We pretend," he said finally, with a bleak conviction. "We pretend it all still makes sense."

He turned back to the mural, running fingers lightly over his previous strokes on Dr. Hitz's shoulder. "We fill blank faces with names, make them important, but in the end, they’re just faceless figures dancing to melodies of someone else's making."

The orderly shifted uncomfortably, "You're not going to--"

But the painter cut him off with a dismissive wave. "This old duck's too stubborn by half. There’s still paint left in me," he mused, before returning to his paints, his existence marked with a quiet rebellion against an immutable cycle.

And so it was, life clinging on amid the surreal mosaic of choices laid bare and the passage of lives given and taken in a world heedless of their sacrifice. The painter picked up his brush, extended it to where Leora Duncan’s visage had been intended, pausing with a final alphabet etched into silent resolve.

"The mural should be finished," he said to no one in particular, the brush lingering like a quill poised at the brink of a definitive line—a testament to persisted legacy against whispered finalities.

In time, the waiting room filled once more. The lives of strangers flowed around him like currents in an ocean heedless of any loss, as whispers of consternation or facile acceptance were met with the systematic cadence of hospital activity embracing complacence—a throbbing symphony to which the painter gently added his silent brushstrokes, a testament to the balance of creation and destruction in a world determined to hold fast against the undying storm of mortality.
