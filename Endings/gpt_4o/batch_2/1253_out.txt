Ending 1: As the night grew deeper, Felicite lay on her bed, the contours of her world dimming with the advancing darkness. Her thoughts meandered through her past life, each memory a gentle tributary leading to the vast sea of her quiet acceptance. Her breathing was slow, each breath carrying the weight of years unlived, of moments cherished, and of dreams gently folded away. 

The room around her settled into stillness, and the air seemed to thicken with a reverence for the simplicity, the purity of a soul soon to depart. Mother Simon sat quietly in a corner, her knitting needles motionless in her lap, watching over Felicite, whose thin chest rose and fell in a rhythm that mimicked the serene ebb and flow of the tides.

Outside, the preparations continued, oblivious to the solemnity within the little room. In Madame Aubain’s yard, the altar was being dressed. It was adorned with white linens, fresh flowers, and the peculiar presence of Loulou, perched regally at the center, watching over it all with his glassy eye. His presence, a humble homage to the life of the simple woman who had cherished him as part of her existence.

The people of Pont-l’Eveque whispered in admiration at the unusual centerpiece, a parrot amidst the sacred icons, adding a quaint charm to the proceedings. The altar’s radiance was a living testament to Felicite’s devotion, her quiet but unyielding love for all creatures and her erstwhile quest for beauty in the ordinary.

As the dawn approached, the soft murmur of prayers began to ascend, rising through the hush like incense, sweetening the air with a tender sanctity. Felicite stirred slightly, her hands, clasped as if in perpetual prayer, relaxed for a moment, finding an otherworldly peace.

Felicite’s spirit roamed lightly, as free as a bird in flight and as anchored as the steadfast roots of an ancient tree. Echoes of her past wandered through her mind, but rather than haunt, they comforted her; the faces that once graced her life shimmered like ethereal phantoms of warmth and solace. For her, the journey toward the eternal was no more daunting than stepping lightly across a threshold she had only ever imagined.

In the yard, the morning light crowned the altar with hues of gold, whispering through petals and lace with soft reverence. Birds began to serenade the waking day, their chorus harmonizing with the rhythm of Felicite’s breath. It was as if the world outside was consciously orchestrating a gentle serenade to ease her passing.

Back in the room, Felicite opened her eyes, though they saw nothing but the muted play of shadows—a silent theater for a life remembered. She exhaled softly, as if allowing a last secret to unspool into the universe. A feeling of release, of unbound ease, gently washed over the room, touching all within it. Her time, at last, had drawn to a close.

At that moment, with the first notes of the organ gently rising from beyond her closed window, Felicite’s soul gracefully embarked on its final voyage, unfettered, unafraid, and profoundly serene.

Within the bustling heartbeat of Pont-l’Eveque, as the congregation gathered to celebrate Corpus Christi, the legacy of Felicite lingered in the air, unassuming yet indelible; her journey now complete, her spirit woven into the silent, sacred tapestry of days. Loulou, watching with unseeing eyes from his perch of honor, bore silent witness as the service commenced, a fitting guardian for the spirit of the woman he had accompanied through life's tapestry.

And so, as the faithful processed past the altar, a sense of tranquility bathed all in attendance, an unspoken understanding of a life well-lived, and of a soul now at peace. Each step in the procession whispered in echo to the love and devotion that Felicite had shown—quiet, steadfast, infinite.

In her passing, Felicite was finally united with all she had loved. And in this reverent quietude, beneath the woven sky and amidst the rising song, the essence and beauty of her devotion soared into the eternal, a testament to the enduring spirit of a humble heart.

Ending 2: As the day of the processional dawned, a stillness lay over the village. The streets appeared deserted, yet a sense of anticipation hung in the air like the whispers of an impending storm. Inside her dim, shadowy room, Felicite lay motionless, her breaths shallow and labored, her consciousness floating in and out like the ebb and flow of distant tides she once imagined Victor roamed.

In the courtyard, women bustled, arranging flowers, hanging drapes, and preparing for the Corpus Christi procession. The air buzzed with quiet activity, the chatter of old acquaintances rekindling momentarily within the solemn preparation. The altar, a white draped table with garlands of lilies and roses, bore Loulou as its peculiar centerpiece, perched proudly amid the candles and incense. The villagers, initially skeptical, now saw the parrot as a humble offering, a symbol of innocence and constancy.

As the church bells began to toll, summoning the faithful to gather, the procession commenced. Children, dressed in white, scattered rose petals from woven baskets, their laughter mingling with the solemn hymns sung joyously by the choir. The elders, dressed in their Sunday best, walked behind the canopy, heads bowed in reverence, their figures casting long shadows in the morning sun.

Inside, Felicite sensed the commotion, though her failing senses could no longer distinguish sight from sound. In her mind, color and melody blended seamlessly into memories both cherished and harrowing. She saw Virginia's smile, youthful and radiant, felt the warmth of Victor's hand in her own, heard Loulou's vibrant call—her son's, her God, her friend who had been with her through all the silence and isolation.

Within those fleeting moments, her spirit soared beyond her frail form. She beheld a world renewed and full, much like her heart once brimmed with unspoken words. As a faint glow of sunlight poured through the half-shuttered window of her room, she envisioned a reunion with those who had traveled ahead, a divine homecoming orchestrated by melodies of faith and love.

Outside, as the priest raised the Eucharist and the congregation knelt, a gust of wind gently swirled around the courtyard, causing the altar cloths and floral arrangements to ripple like waves along a gentle shore. Loulou, seemingly animated for the briefest of moments, tilted his hollow head as if blessing the assembly with a final benediction.

And lying in her narrow bed, wrapped in the whispers of sacred hymns and the sweet scent of incense drifting through the open window, Felicite exhaled softly one last time. She was cradled in serene tranquility, her last breath mingling with the eternal hum of creation, free from pain and yearning.

Far away, as roses settled upon cobblestones, the townsfolk remained unchanged, their lives following the steady beat of time like the turning of seasons. Yet, in the heart of every villager, in the soul of Pont-l’Eveque, the memory of a simple servant girl formed a newfound grace—a testament to enduring devotion, both humbled and transcendent.

For her offering was a life where love, in the guise of service, stood eternal amid epochs of change—where both brightness and shadow were gracefully borne. And as her spirit took flight with the distant ringing of bells, the village unknowingly whispered her epitaph: Here lies Felicite, the embodiment of quietly spoken tenderness, woven into the fabric of creation—a kindness unfathomable in its grandeur and serenity, like the soft flutter of a dove on the breath of God.

With the afternoon sun slowly climbing higher, the procession would continue, unfaltering, past the diminishing echo of tolls, past the flower-adorned altars and renewed vows. And somewhere beyond the horizon, wrapped in timeless embrace, Felicite walked alongside Virginia, beside Victor, in a garden yet more vibrant and true—held forever, happy beneath God's gentle, watchful gaze.

Ending 3: The next morning, the streets of Pont-l’Évêque were bustling with excitement and festivity as the procession for Corpus Christi began. Flowers were scattered on the cobblestones, their sweet fragrance mingling with the incense that wafted through the air. The altar, set up in Madame Aubain's yard, was resplendent with garlands and decorations, and at its center, in a place of honor, stood Loulou, perched on a pedestal that was slightly askew.

The townsfolk gathered to admire the spectacle, and Felicite's neighbors murmured in benevolent indulgence at the sight of the parrot presiding over the altar. For many, it was just a curious addition to the traditional displays, yet for those few who knew its significance, it was a testament to Felicite's peculiar devotion and her simple, unwavering faith.

Inside the dim, cool room where Felicite lay, the hushed tones of the congregation reached her, softened and distant. The sun cast gentle fingers of light onto her bed, creating patterns that seemed to dance slowly, mirroring the languid motions of her own ebbing life. Her breath was shallow now, her old body no longer inclined to struggle against its bounds.

Though her ears no longer served her well, somehow there was a serenity in her mind. Fleeting images came to her—Virginia smiling and barefoot among wildflowers, Victor as a boy turning to wave on the ship's deck, and Madame in her younger days, lifting her from the dust of the street. Loulou's voice mingled with those memories, his recorded phrases echoing like distant music in her thoughts.

Time slipped away as she floated between waking and dreams, her soul barely tethered to the earth. From far off, she seemed to hear her name called, though she could not be certain if it was real or imagined.

The procession was nearing its conclusion, winding its way through the narrow streets where lamps were already being lit against the creeping twilight. The final prayers were said, and the children, dressed in white, scattered petals as they meandered, singing with clear voices.

In that moment, within the quiet solitude of her room, Felicite experienced a profound sense of presence. The faces she loved, momentarily forgotten, seemed to be before her once more. Her heart swelled with a warmth that transcended the boundaries of flesh and bone.

With a gentle sigh, like the whisper of leaves in a soft wind, Felicite's spirit departed from its earthly shell. Her features, worn by time yet marked by kindness, smoothed in repose, and a small, contented smile lingered upon her lips.

Outside, the people began to disband, returning to their homes, their hearts lightened by the day's celebrations. Inside, Felicite's stillness went unnoticed amidst the creaking floorboards and the murmurs that filled the house.

As darkness enveloped Pont-l’Évêque, a quietude fell over the town once more. The altar remained illuminated, tiny flames flickering like distant stars.

The priest remembered his promise and would often recount Felicite's story, speaking of her unswerving faith and simple joys, with Loulou still holding vigil from his perch. Over time, the parrot became a curiosity, a cherished relic that reminded all who saw it of the woman whose love had been so boundless, so uniquely expressed.

In the quiet years that followed, Felicite's simple legacy became intertwined with the local faith, and though the names of her loved ones grew dim in the collective memory of the town, her spirit was enshrined in the hearts of those who had known her, as enduring as the small, resplendent figure of the Holy Ghost that she had cherished above all.

Ending 4: As dusk settled in, the stillness in Felicité's room deepened. The dim light of the evening hesitantly entered through the window, casting gentle shadows across the floor. Despite the sombre quiet, a comforting warmth seemed to emanate from the figure on the bed. Felicité lay motionless, her breathing shallow yet peaceful. Her failing senses no longer perceived the world around her as they once did, but some part of her, beyond the physical, remained acutely aware.

The day had been a whirlwind of emotion, yet the chaos subsided into a curious calm. In the room's silence, Felicité's lips moved softly, almost imperceptibly, as she murmured her well-worn prayers. Her mind drifted, untethered by space or time. Memories surfaced like vivid dreams—the faces of Virginia, of Victor, and of Madame Aubain blending harmoniously with laughter, the scent of lavender, and a young woman's heart open to love and duty.

Outside, the preparations for the festival neared completion. The altar in Madame Aubain's yard, where Loulou perched conspicuously atop his new pedestal, attracted curious glances and nods of approval. The neighbourhood, sensing the weight of the moment, moved with quiet reverence as floral wreaths were carefully placed and candles were lit, their flames flickering with the whisper of the breeze.

Inside, the dimness gave way to a soft glow. Felicité's breathing became rhythmic, syncing with a tranquility she could not have articulated. She smiled to herself, a small, contented smile as she felt her spirit unburdened. Her earthly attachment to pain and longing seemed to dissolve into the edges of twilight. In place of sorrow, a pure, encompassing love settled in—a love that transcended the losses she had borne.

In her gentle revere, she imagined clouds parting slowly, revealing a vast, encompassing light—endless as the sky and warm like the afternoon sun. Within that brilliance, she envisioned everyone she held dear holding hands, each gesture tender and unspoken. The sound of Virginia's laughter and Victor's stories mingled, echoing throughout the air, yet distinct and enchanting like a distant melody carried by the wind.

A flutter at her bedside drew her attention back. Loulou—his vibrant plumage as vivid as it had been in his youth—seemed to nod knowingly in her direction. For a moment, she could almost hear his voice, comforting and familiar. He was there, not as the bird she had tended with devotion, but as a living spirit in her dream; his essence unwavering—a reminder of happiness found in small, cherished moments.

Satisfied at last, Felicité felt herself stepping forward, not with feet nor intention, but as though a gentle breeze had lifted her. She felt her soul unfurl like the sails she had often imagined on a ship bound for distant lands. Her heart swelled, not with the anguish of unachieved dreams but with the quiet fulfillment of all that had been—every simple, treasured act of fidelity.

Outside, beneath the growing night, the faithful began their procession. The light from the candles bathed the street—now lined with admirers and friends—in a warm, golden glow. Subtle whispers captured the shared unity of purpose, and the sound harmonized with the swell of evening bells, solidifying the sacredness of the gathering.

Inside, Felicité's last breath escaped her lips as gently as a sigh—a benediction spoken softly to the world she had loved fiercely. Her face, serene and at ease, remained turned towards the window, beyond which the stars now began to appear, one by one, like old companions greeting her with quiet affirmation.

Unseen by all, within the chapel-like confines of her room, a small miracle unfolded. With her passing, the air seemed to shimmer briefly, as if blessed by an invisible, guiding hand. And though the room returned once more to its dusky stillness, it held a light—resplendent and eternal—borne aloft by a soul newly freed.

In the quiet reverence of that moment, and for long thereafter, those who entered would feel it subtly but surely—the ineffable, unyielding love of Felicité, now wrapped around all she left, as gentle as her dreams and as enduring as her faith.

Outside, the procession moved onward, its light spilling into shadows, filling the night with remembrance and hope. And among the whispers of the living and the echoes of spirits that wandered softly, wordlessly somewhere just beyond, Felicité's legacy lingered, serene and ever present, in the heartbeats of those who remained.

Ending 5: As the altar preparations commenced, a soft stillness descended upon Madame Aubain's deserted yard. A gentle breeze whispered through the surviving trees, carrying with it the scents of blooming lilies cradled in the garlands strung by the townspeople. Loulou the parrot stood proudly on the altar, a relic of bright plumage amidst the array of white and green. His once vibrant feathers had faded, serving as a testament to the passage of time, yet his presence recalled memories dear to Felicite, embedding him forever in the fabric of her heart.

The townspeople gathered, their whispers mingling with the rustle of leaves—a soft, melodious harmony that seemed to rise up to the heavens. Despite her failing health, Felicite had insisted on the parrot's inclusion in the celebration. To her, Loulou represented not only her connection to past loves and lives but also a divine union with the Holy Spirit.

Felicite, now bedridden, lay in her dim room with only the muted echoes of life just beyond her walls. Her breathing had grown shallow, but it was calm, synchronized with the gentle ticking of the clock and the distant pealing of church bells. Her cares and concerns, once immobilizing in their weight, had slowly been lifted, transcending into her enduring faith.

As the Corpus Christi procession began, the streets came alive with sacred resonance—the voices of those in song, the fragrant incense curling up into the soft afternoon air, and the longing bystanders finding comfort in shared prayer. Felicite’s room remained untouched by the noise, its peace a sanctuary from worldly interruptions.

She drifted in and out of awareness, memories floating in her mind like the scattered rays of the afternoon sun filtering through the shutters. Images of Paul and Virginia, Monsieur, Madame Aubain, even her lost nephew Victor intertwined with the figures of saints and angels in her mind. Her fingers, gnarled and frail, clutched the well-worn edge of her bed linen, while her lips moved silently in prayer, comforted by the familiarity of the words.

Outside, the altar shone in the warm sunlight, the parrot perched solemnly at its center, as if keeping vigil over the sacred day. Children played nearby, their laughter punctuating the litanies with life’s ceaseless melody. A butterfly fluttered by, momentarily pausing to land delicately on Loulou’s gilded beak, as if blessing the moment with its fragile beauty.

Inside, Felicite murmured something unintelligible, a voice from another realm, gentle and filled with wonder. Her spirit, quietly transcending the confines of her ailing body, soared over the barriers of time, space, and circumstance, finally at peace.

The procession neared its conclusion, the sacred chanting gradually fading into the quiet streets. As the last echoes of the hymns retreated, a single sunbeam pierced the sheltering clouds, casting columns of light throughout the yard and illuminating Loulou on his perch. The remembered presence of a thousand yesterdays lingered in his glassy eye, and for a fleeting instant, Felicite saw not a parrot, but a sign of divine grace.

Her last breath was a gentle sigh, a release into eternity. In that moment, her worn, faithful heart, bound by strands of simple devotion and shared memories, found unity with the eternal presence that had been her lifelong companion.

As the community disbanded, their warmth lingered in her humble abode. Loulou, resting among the flowers of the altar, remained a symbol of Felicite’s enduring hope, love, and her transcendent connection—unity with all that she cherished, all that she had never stopped loving.

The sun slowly descended beyond the town, its light lingering on the horizon, comforting even as dusk gathered—a soft nod to the continuous cycle of nature and spirit. Felicite, a humble servant in life, unequals’ arm with a parrot in her heart, had risen to join the sanctified chorus, carrying with her a legacy of simple, profound humanity.

And within the quiet reaches of Heaven, where loved ones awaited with open arms, Felicite would never again be lonely.
