## Ending 1: The Return

Mirestone poured another drink. He leaned back in the chair and placed the glass to his lips. He was tilted so far back that as he raised the wine to a drinking position, it blocked his view of the room. As he slowly sipped it, however, the room began to come into view--the ceiling first and slowly the wall. His eyes focused on a piece of thread hanging from the ceiling, and as the wine sank lower and lower in the glass, the thread grew longer and longer until in one last swallow he was able to see the end of the line.

Mirestone's hand went stiff as he looked at the thread, for on the end of it was a pure white feather.

In an instant Mirestone realized that the hex had not worked. Peter's death at the bridge had been a grotesque coincidence. Had the untimely plunge in the rapids been the result of the hex the feather would have long since been red, therefore, the tragedy was no more than an accident and Mirestone's hands were innocent of the Dutchman's blood. That realization, of course, didn't bother him, for he was not concerned whether or not he was responsible for Peter's death, but he was genuinely worried in the failure of the hex. He wondered if he had done something wrong. If he had, the last link, that could have corrected him was broken. From here on in he was on his own.

He calmed himself and began to think. He retraced everything that he had done to see if he couldn't have found some margin in which error could have crept in. He remembered how carefully he had bent over the feather reciting the exact words taught him by Peter. He especially remembered that part of the hex, for hadn't the feather been ruffled by his breath when he spoke....

Gradually the truth began to dawn on Mirestone. His own breath must have released Peter from the hex. The last person's breath that touched the feather would feel the sting of the power. Mirestone sat back dumbfounded. He was to be his own guinea pig. What ghastly horror was he in for? Would he die quickly like the goat or would his death be prolonged over a period of days like Peter had suggested. He gripped himself. It wouldn't do to lose control of his senses. There must be a way out of the predicament. But Peter said that as soon as the feather turned red there was no turning back. Ah--there's the answer. The feather is still white... there's still a chance.

Mirestone grabbed his cloak and raced for the door. He must get an animal--another goat, perhaps, and expose the feather to its breath. He must hurry lest the spell will start working.

The slippery mud dragged him back and impeded his progress, but he struggled on through the blinding storm towards the barn. It was so black outside that he could hardly make out the buildings. All at once he saw the barn looming ahead of him. Which door? Every second counted; he would try the first one he came to. Wait--what's this holding his cloak? Mirestone turned and fumbled with some barbed wire fencing. It had snagged him in the dark, and he soon became hopelessly entangled in it. Crying and shrieking, he tore the cloak from his shoulders and ran on in his shirt sleeves. He wrenched open a door and sprawled in the barn head first. On his hands and knees he scurried across the mealy floor to the goat stall. The kids sprang in terror as he lurched in drunkenly, grabbing about in the dark for one of them. Catching one by the hind leg, he groped his way out again.

Thrusting his shoulders forward he slid through the gripping mud, tearing his way through the engulfing rain with his free hand. His leg felt numb from the wound inflicted by the barbed wire, and a trickle of blood was running down his shins. Without thinking he reached down to rub the wound, but quickly yanked his hand up again. What was that horrible sensation he felt as he passed his hand over the fleshy sore? He couldn't see in the rain, but his leg told him that it was something hairy, almost bristly.

He ran on towards the house, stumbling in the treacherous mud. Once he fell completely down in the slime. Wiping the dripping earth from his face, he was told again that something was wrong. His cheeks verified his shin's story of a rough, jagged caress.

Holding his hand in front of his face he saw, amidst a flash of lightning, a curling, black claw, bristling with long, ragged hairs. Screaming hysterically he dropped the kid and fell forward into the door of the house. The latch gave way with his weight and he tumbled into the cottage.

Dancing madly on the end of a thread was a blood red feather.

Mirestone howled in terror, watching his hands transform before his eyes. Coarse hair sprouted from every pore, his nails hardening and curving into claws. The pain was excruciating, his bones cracking and reforming as his very skeleton changed shape.

The door to the cottage burst open, and several men from the village rushed in, lanterns held high. They froze at the sight before them – no longer a man, but not quite beast, Mirestone writhed on the floor in the final stages of his transformation.

"The white feather hex," whispered one of the men, pointing to the blood-red feather still dancing on its thread.

"But Peter is dead," said another. "How could this be?"

The eldest among them stepped forward cautiously. "The hex works of its own power once set in motion. Peter may be gone, but his vengeance lives on."

As the creature that had been Mirestone rose on newly formed haunches, the men backed toward the door. Its eyes, still human and filled with agony, met theirs in a silent plea.

The eldest villager raised his rifle. "This is mercy," he said quietly, and fired.

After it was done, they buried the twisted remains deep in the forest, far from consecrated ground. And in the years that followed, mothers would warn their children never to venture near that place, where the white feather hex had claimed its final victim – the man who had sought its power without understanding its price.

## Ending 2: The Transformation

Mirestone's hand went stiff as he looked at the thread, for on the end of it was a pure white feather.

Realization dawned upon him that the hex had failed—Peter's death had been mere coincidence. He sat back, a mixture of disappointment and relief washing over him. His quest for the power of the white feather hex had led to nothing.

Yet as he stared at the feather, something odd began to happen. It started to twitch, almost imperceptibly at first, then with increasing vigor, as if alive. Mirestone blinked, wondering if the wine had affected his vision.

The feather began to emit a soft, pulsing glow—not the red of death that Peter had described, but a strange, pearlescent luminescence. The light spread throughout the room, touching every corner, every shadow.

Mirestone felt a tingling sensation in his fingers, spreading up his arms. He tried to move but found himself frozen in place, able only to watch as the glow intensified.

"What is happening?" he whispered.

As if in answer, the door creaked open. But instead of a human figure, a great white bird entered—larger than any Mirestone had ever seen, with intelligent eyes that fixed upon him with unmistakable purpose.

Understanding came to him in a flash. The hex of the white feather was not merely a death curse as Peter had believed. It was something far more ancient, far more profound—a transformation.

The bird approached, its movements graceful and deliberate. When it was mere inches from him, it spread its magnificent wings, enveloping Mirestone in a cloud of white feathers that seemed to dissolve into his very skin.

Pain such as he had never known coursed through his body. He felt his bones hollowing, his skin hardening into something that was not quite skin anymore. His vision sharpened, colors becoming more vibrant than he had ever perceived them.

"The hex..." he gasped, as his voice changed, becoming something between a human cry and a bird's call. "It changes... us..."

Days later, the villagers would discover Mirestone's abandoned clothes in Peter Scheinberger's house, with no sign of the man himself. Some would claim to have seen a pair of great white birds soaring high above the gorge where Peter had supposedly died—birds such as had never been seen in those parts before.

And in the years that followed, stories would spread of the White Guardians of the forest—creatures that were neither fully bird nor human, who watched over the land with ancient wisdom and protected those who respected the old ways.

But few would connect these legends with the strange disappearance of Peter Scheinberger and the mysterious folklore researcher who had come seeking the secret of the white feather hex. And none would guess that in finding that secret, both men had been transformed into something that transcended the boundary between life and death—guardians of a power that was never meant to be merely a weapon, but a doorway to a different kind of existence.

As for the hex itself, its true nature remained hidden in the memories of two beings who soared above human concerns, carrying with them the knowledge that some secrets are not meant to be written down, but lived.

## Ending 3: The Cycle

Mirestone's hand went stiff as he looked at the thread, for on the end of it was a pure white feather.

In an instant Mirestone realized that the hex had not worked. Peter's death at the bridge had been a grotesque coincidence. Had the untimely plunge in the rapids been the result of the hex the feather would have long since been red.

He calmed himself and began to think, retracing everything he had done. The truth dawned on him—his own breath must have released Peter from the hex when he spoke the incantation. The last person's breath that touched the feather would feel the sting of the power.

Panic seized him. He grabbed his cloak and raced for the door. He must find another animal—another goat, perhaps—and expose the feather to its breath before the spell took hold of him.

The night was black and rain-soaked. Mirestone stumbled through mud, his heart racing. The barn loomed ahead, but as he reached for its door, a strange sensation overtook him. His limbs grew heavy, his vision blurred.

"No," he gasped. "Not yet. I need more time."

He collapsed in the mud, rainwater pooling around him. As consciousness faded, he saw a figure approaching—a woman, tall and stern, with eyes that seemed to hold ancient knowledge.

"Who...?" he managed to whisper.

"I am Mara," she said. "Peter Scheinberger's sister."

Understanding dawned on Mirestone with terrible clarity. There had been no sister mentioned in his research. She was something else entirely.

When Mirestone awoke, he found himself inside a small cottage he didn't recognize. The woman, Mara, sat across from him, watching with those same knowing eyes.

"You sought the white feather hex," she said. It wasn't a question.

"How did you—?"

"Many have sought it before you," she interrupted. "None have truly understood its purpose."

She rose and brought him a steaming cup. "Drink," she commanded.

Too weak to resist, Mirestone obeyed.

"The hex is not meant to kill," Mara explained, watching him closely. "It is meant to choose."

"Choose what?" Mirestone asked, feeling strength returning to his limbs.

"The next keeper." She smiled, a cold, knowing smile. "My brother was never supposed to die. He was supposed to pass the knowledge to a worthy successor. When he refused and burned the book, he broke the cycle. But the hex finds a way. Always."

Mirestone looked down at his hands and noticed with horror that they were changing—becoming older, weather-beaten, like Peter's had been.

"What's happening to me?" he gasped.

"You're becoming the new keeper," Mara said simply. "The hex has chosen you. In your arrogance, you sought power. Now you have it, along with responsibility that will last the rest of your days."

"And if I refuse?"

"Then you will die, and the hex will find another. But I don't think you'll refuse." Her eyes bored into his. "I think you've always known you were searching for something more than just folklore to record in your books."

In that moment, Mirestone knew she was right. His entire life had been leading to this—this transformation, this inheritance of ancient power.

"What must I do?" he asked.

Mara handed him a small, leather-bound book—the very one Peter had claimed to have burned.

"Learn," she said. "Guard. And when the time comes, choose more wisely than my brother did."

Twenty years later, a young scholar would arrive at the home of one Martin Scheinberger, a reclusive folklorist known for his extensive knowledge of Pennsylvania Dutch traditions. The scholar would be seeking information about obscure hexes and charms.

And Martin—once known as Mirestone—would study the young man carefully, wondering if the time had finally come to pass on the knowledge of the white feather, and with it, the burden and the blessing he had carried for so long.

For the hex always found a way. Always.

## Ending 4: The Truth

Mirestone's hand went stiff as he looked at the thread, for on the end of it was a pure white feather.

In an instant Mirestone realized that the hex had not worked. Peter's death at the bridge had been a grotesque coincidence. Had the untimely plunge in the rapids been the result of the hex, the feather would have long since been red.

He calmed himself and began to think, retracing everything he had done. The truth dawned on him—his own breath must have released Peter from the hex when he spoke the incantation. The last person's breath that touched the feather would feel the sting of the power.

Mirestone sat back dumbfounded. He was to be his own guinea pig. What ghastly horror was he in for?

A sound at the door made him turn. A man stood there—not Peter, but someone with the same stocky build and wary eyes. Behind him were several others, all regarding Mirestone with unmistakable hostility.

"Who are you?" Mirestone demanded.

"Welkir Scheinberger," the man replied. "Peter's cousin." His eyes flicked to the white feather hanging from the rafter. "And I see you've found what you came for."

Mirestone tried to appear calm. "Your cousin had an unfortunate accident. He was showing me the local landmarks and—"

"Save your lies," Welkir cut in. "We know Peter would never show the white feather hex to an outsider willingly. And we know he would never go near that bridge in a storm."

The men moved into the room, surrounding Mirestone. One of them pointed to the feather.

"It hasn't turned red," he said to Welkir.

Welkir nodded. "Because it wasn't properly performed. This man knows nothing of our ways."

"What are you going to do?" Mirestone asked, trying to keep the tremor from his voice.

Welkir pulled something from his pocket—a small, leather-bound book. "First, we're going to show you what the white feather hex truly is."

He opened the book to a marked page and began to read in a language Mirestone didn't understand. As the words filled the room, the feather began to glow—not red, but with a cold, blue light.

"The white feather hex is not for killing," Welkir explained, his voice steady. "It's for truth. It compels the one marked by it to speak only truth, to reveal the darkness in their heart."

The blue light from the feather intensified, seeming to penetrate Mirestone's very being. He felt his carefully constructed facade crumbling under its influence.

"Now," Welkir said, "tell us why you really came here."

The words poured from Mirestone against his will: "I came seeking power. I've spent years hunting down forgotten magic, using it for my own gain. I've ruined lives, stolen knowledge, even killed when necessary." He gasped, fighting the compulsion, but could not stop. "I thought the white feather hex would give me the ultimate power—control over life and death itself."

One of the men spat on the floor. "And Peter?"

"I pushed him," Mirestone confessed, tears streaming down his face. "When he refused to demonstrate the hex on a human subject... when he threatened to expose me... I seized him and pushed him from the bridge."

Welkir closed the book. "The hex has done its work. Now comes judgment."

"What will you do to me?" Mirestone whispered, slumped in his chair.

"Nothing," Welkir said, surprising him. "The hex itself will administer justice. You sought to pervert its purpose, to use it for death when it was meant for truth. Such an offense has its own consequence."

As if on cue, the feather burst into flame—not the red glow of hex-death, but natural, consuming fire. In seconds, it was ash.

Mirestone felt a crushing weight upon his chest, a tightening in his throat. But it wasn't death approaching—it was something worse.

"From this day forward," Welkir pronounced, "you will speak only truth. Every lie you attempt will choke in your throat. Every deception will burn like fire in your mind. This is the true power of the white feather—to strip away falsehood and leave only naked truth."

They left him there, a man whose greatest weapon—deceit—had been forever taken from him. In the years that followed, Martin G. Mirestone would wander from place to place, a broken man unable to manipulate or beguile. Some said he eventually found peace as a monk in a remote monastery, where truth was valued above all things.

And in the small Dutch community, the story of the white feather hex was passed down through generations—not as a tale of death and vengeance, but as a reminder that the most powerful magic of all was simply truth, unvarnished and absolute.

## Ending 5: The Legacy

Mirestone's hand went stiff as he looked at the thread, for on the end of it was a pure white feather.

In an instant Mirestone realized that the hex had not worked. Peter's death at the bridge had been a grotesque coincidence. Had the untimely plunge in the rapids been the result of the hex the feather would have long since been red.

He calmed himself and began to think, retracing everything he had done. The truth dawned on him—his own breath must have released Peter from the hex when he spoke the incantation. The last person's breath that touched the feather would feel the sting of the power.

Mirestone grabbed his cloak, resolved to flee before the hex could claim him. As he rushed to the door, something caught his eye—a small wooden chest tucked beneath Peter's bed, partially visible in the dim light.

Curiosity overcoming fear, he pulled it out. Inside was a stack of yellowing papers covered in spidery handwriting. Mirestone recognized it immediately as the same hand that had written the book Peter claimed to have burned.

The top page bore a single title: "The True Nature of the White Feather Hex."

Despite his urgent need to escape, Mirestone could not resist. He began to read, and as he did, his eyes widened with understanding.

The hex was not what Peter had claimed. It was not a simple death curse, but something far more complex. According to these notes, written by Peter's grandfather Otto, the white feather hex was a test—a way to determine who was worthy of the Scheinberger family's greatest secret.

Those who sought the hex for selfish reasons, for power or vengeance, would indeed find death. But those who approached it with respect and understanding would discover something else entirely—a doorway to knowledge beyond ordinary comprehension.

The feather would turn red only for the unworthy. For the worthy, it would remain white, but would bestow a gift—the ability to see beyond the veil that separated the visible world from what lay beyond.

Mirestone looked back at the feather, still pristine white, swinging gently from its thread. Had he passed the test? But how could that be, when his intentions had been far from pure?

As if in answer to his unspoken question, the door creaked open. Mirestone turned, expecting to see villagers come to avenge Peter's death. Instead, a small boy stood there, perhaps ten years old, with Peter's eyes and solemn expression.

"You're the man who was talking to my father," the boy said simply.

"Your father?" Mirestone was stunned. Peter had never mentioned a son.

"Yes. He told me you might come." The boy stepped inside, unafraid. "He said you were searching for something important."

"Your father is dead," Mirestone said bluntly, then regretted his harshness as the boy's face remained impassive.

"I know," the child replied. "He knew it might happen. That's why he sent me away yesterday, to stay with my aunt. He told me to come back today, to find either him or you."

Mirestone felt a chill. "He knew?"

The boy nodded. "He said the white feather would choose." He pointed to the still-white feather. "And it has."

Understanding dawned on Mirestone with stunning clarity. Peter had known the true purpose of the hex all along. He had played the reluctant teacher, the superstitious peasant, all to test Mirestone's character and intentions.

"Why did he do this?" Mirestone whispered. "Why the deception?"

"The knowledge has to pass to someone," the boy said. "But it can't be just anyone. Father said our family has carried the burden long enough. He was looking for someone else—someone with the intellect to understand and the strength to bear it."

"And he chose me? After everything?"

The boy shrugged. "The feather chose you. It remains white."

Mirestone looked back at the papers in his hand, then at the child. "What happens now?"

"Now you learn. Truly learn, not just collect facts for your books." The boy's eyes seemed suddenly older than his years. "And when I'm old enough, you'll teach me too, so the knowledge isn't lost."

That night, as Mirestone pored over Otto Scheinberger's papers by candlelight, he began to understand the true magnitude of what he had stumbled upon. The white feather hex was merely the beginning—a key that unlocked a system of knowledge that blended folk magic with profound insights into the nature of reality itself.

Years later, scholars would note a curious change in the works of Martin G. Mirestone. His earlier publications—dry catalogs of folklore and superstition—gave way to profound philosophical treatises that hinted at wisdom beyond ordinary understanding. And always at his side was a young man known as Peter Mirestone, his adopted son and student.

They never spoke publicly about the white feather hex. But those who visited their home often remarked on the single white feather preserved under glass on Mirestone's desk—a reminder, he would say with a smile, that the most valuable knowledge often comes from the most unexpected sources.
