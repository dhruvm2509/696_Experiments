Ending 1:
Years after the Hagle's Disease Foundation had been established, William Hagle discovered the true nature of his existence. The Hexers hadn't simply been punishing him—they had been studying him. He was an experiment, a living probe into human resilience, designed to test the limits of psychological and temporal manipulation.

Dr. Wise called him into his office one final time. The walls seemed to shimmer, reality bending at the edges. "We've learned everything we needed to know," Wise said, his form flickering between human and something entirely alien.

Hagle understood now. The voice that had always spoken for him, the monsters that had haunted him, the impossible luck that had both cursed and saved him—it was all part of a grand experiment conducted across time and space. His entire life had been a controlled variable, a test of human adaptability.

The time machine in Miss Tompkins' basement was nothing more than a prop, a distraction. The real manipulation happened on a level beyond human comprehension. Hagle had been observed, tested, pushed to his limits, and ultimately preserved—not out of cruelty, but out of a cold, scientific curiosity.

As Wise spoke, Hagle realized he was no longer in the hospital, no longer in any recognizable time or place. He was suspended in a moment of pure observation, his entire existence reduced to data points and psychological profiles.

"We appreciate your cooperation," Wise said, his voice echoing from everywhere and nowhere.

And then, silence.

Ending 2:
The final irony was not lost on William Hagle. After all the years of persecution, after all the moments of inexplicable misfortune, he had become something entirely unexpected—a medical marvel, a foundation, a disease named after him that no one could quite understand.

Sitting in the hospital room, surrounded by researchers and doctors who treated him like a living specimen, Hagle reflected on the journey. The Hexers, those mysterious future entities who had tormented him, seemed to have lost interest. Miss Tompkins and her time machine were distant memories.

Dr. Wise entered, looking perplexed. "William, we've run every test imaginable. You're perfectly healthy, yet somehow... different. Your blood work, your cellular structure—it's as if you're both completely normal and utterly unique."

Hagle smiled. The voice that had haunted him for years had gone silent. The monsters that had plagued his childhood had disappeared. He had outlasted his tormentors.

"Maybe," Hagle said, "I'm just lucky."

But they both knew it was more complicated than luck. Something had changed. The temporal hex that had defined his entire existence had transformed him into something more than human, yet entirely human at the same time.

As night fell, Hagle looked out the hospital window. For the first time in his life, he felt completely, utterly free.

Ending 3:
The government bond remained untouched, a silent testament to Hagle's patience and determination. The Hexers had gone quiet, their elaborate revenge plot seemingly abandoned. But William Hagle knew better than to believe it was over.

One morning, Dr. Wise entered with a stack of papers and an expression of pure scientific excitement. "William, you're not going to believe this. We've traced the anomalies in your medical history. They're not random—they're a precise, calculated pattern."

The time machine's true purpose was finally revealed. It wasn't just a tool for hexing or revenge. It was a complex observation device, tracking human potential through deliberate interference. Hagle had been a test subject in a massive, multigenerational experiment about human resilience.

"They wanted to see how much a single human could endure," Wise explained. "And you—you survived. Not just survived, but thrived."

The Hagle's Disease Foundation became more than a medical curiosity. It became proof of human adaptability, of the capacity to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles.

Hagle looked at the government bond, understanding now that his entire life had been preparation for this moment of revelation.

Ending 4:
In the quiet moments between medical tests and foundation meetings, William Hagle discovered something profound. The Hexers hadn't been punishing him—they had been protecting him.

The seemingly random interventions, the voices, the monsters, the inexplicable moments of both misfortune and luck—they were a complex system of temporal guardianship. Every time Hagle approached true danger, something had pulled him back.

Dr. Wise's research revealed a startling truth. Hagle was a nexus point, a critical junction in a timeline that branched in multiple directions. The Hexers weren't his enemies—they were preserving a potential future that depended on his survival.

"You're more important than you could ever understand," Wise told him one evening.

The government bond remained untouched, a symbol of a future yet to be determined. Hagle realized his life was not a punishment, but a preparation.

For what, he didn't yet know.

Ending 5:
The final twist came not from the Hexers, not from Miss Tompkins, but from within Hagle himself. As the years passed and the Foundation grew, he began to understand that the greatest hex had been his own perception.

Those monsters, those voices, the inexplicable misfortunes—they were manifestations of his own fear, his own unresolved traumas. The time machine was real, the Hexers were real, but their power had always been rooted in his belief in their control.

Dr. Wise watched in amazement as Hagle systematically dismantled the psychological constructs that had defined his entire existence. Each therapy session, each medical test, was a step toward understanding.

"You're healing yourself," Wise observed.

And Hagle was. The government bond remained a symbol of potential, of a future not yet written. The Hexers had become nothing more than distant memories, their power dissolving under the light of self-understanding.

In the end, the greatest time machine was the human mind—capable of rewriting its own history, of transcending its perceived limitations.
