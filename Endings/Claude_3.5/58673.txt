Ending 1:
The room of machinery hummed with a dormant power that seemed to pulse between life and death. Asir and Mara stood frozen as Big Joe's mechanical voice continued to drone its ancient protocols. The robot's massive form blocked the doorway, its blood-stained talons a stark reminder of the violence that had just occurred.

"The fusion reaction must be renewed," Asir muttered, more to himself than to Mara or the machine. He approached the panels of white circles and dials, his fingers trembling with a mixture of fear and anticipation.

Big Joe's eyes tracked his movement. "_Technologist,_" the machine intoned, "_you are not authorized to activate the system._"

Mara pressed close to Asir, her previous bravado replaced by a raw fear. "What are you doing?" she whispered.

"Saving our world," he replied.

The panels seemed to come alive under his touch. Memories of stolen ritual phrases, fragments of ancient knowledge stolen from his masters, now coalesced into a desperate plan. The air of Mars was dying, leaking away into the vast emptiness of space. This machine—this last hope—was their only chance.

A series of lights began to flicker. Dials spun. Big Joe took a step forward, then stopped.

"_Warning,_" the machine announced. "_Unauthorized activation detected._"

But something had changed. The robot did not attack. Instead, it seemed to be waiting, observing.

Asir turned to Mara. "The Blaze of the Winds," he said. "It's not a weapon. It's a restoration."

Outside, the priests and townspeople had fled. Only Welkir remained, a broken figure at the edge of the corridor. The sounds of machinery grew louder, more insistent.

"We're going to die," Mara said.

Asir smiled. "No. We're going to live."

Ending 2:
The vaults were silent now, save for the mechanical breathing of Big Joe and the distant echoes of Slubil's violent end. Asir approached the panels of machinery, his stolen knowledge burning in his mind like a fever.

"_Technologists must provide authorization,_" Big Joe intoned.

Mara watched, her previous contempt replaced by a curious mixture of fear and wonder. "What are you going to do?"

Asir's fingers traced the white circles, finding patterns that only a ritual-thief would recognize. "The air is dying," he said. "Mars is dying. And only we can save it."

The machine seemed to consider this. Its massive head turned, mechanical eyes studying them with an intelligence that defied its metallic nature. "_The last technicians departed centuries ago,_" Big Joe said. "_You are not them._"

"We are all that remains," Asir replied.

A single lever caught his attention. No markings, no clear indication of its purpose. But something in the way Big Joe's gaze lingered suggested its importance.

"Help me," he said to Mara.

Together, they pulled the lever.

For a moment, nothing happened.

Then the entire vault began to vibrate.

Ending 3:
The room was a cathedral of forgotten technology. Big Joe stood like a sentinel, his metallic form both threat and guardian. Asir understood now that the monster was more than a simple machine—it was the last guardian of humanity's hope on Mars.

"_Explain your purpose,_" the robot demanded.

Asir recounted the stolen knowledge—how Mars was dying, how the air leaked away, how the ancient technologies had been forgotten. Mara listened, her previous mockery replaced by a growing understanding.

Big Joe's eyes flickered. Processing. Analyzing.

"The Blaze of the Winds is not a weapon," Asir said. "It's a restoration system."

A panel opened in the wall. Scrolls and data crystals emerged, preserved for generations. Big Joe spoke again: "_Technicians must be verified. Prove your knowledge._"

What followed was not a battle, but an examination. Every stolen ritual phrase, every fragment of ancient wisdom Asir had collected, was tested and verified.

Mara watched in awe as her thief—her impossible, infuriating companion—became something more.

Ending 4:
Slubil's broken body lay where Big Joe had discarded it, a testament to the machine's brutal efficiency. Asir approached the control panels, Mara close behind him.

"_Intruders are not permitted,_" Big Joe announced.

But something in Asir's stolen knowledge gave the machine pause. The ritual phrases, memorized and pieced together like a complex puzzle, began to make sense.

"We are the last hope," Asir said.

The machine's eyes seemed to calculate, to weigh, to consider. Outside, the world of Mars continued its slow death—the air leaking away, civilization crumbling into ignorance and ritual.

Big Joe made a decision.

Ending 5:
The vault was a tomb of forgotten technology, and Asir was its unlikely resurrector. Big Joe loomed, part guardian, part executioner, watching as the thief's fingers danced across panels that had not been touched in generations.

"_Identify,_" the machine demanded.

Mara watched, her previous contempt transformed into something like respect. Asir was no longer just a thief. He was a prophet of sorts, carrying fragments of knowledge stolen from those who would have kept it hidden.

The Blaze of the Winds was not a weapon of destruction, but a promise of renewal.

As the first lights began to pulse, Asir understood: some thefts are sacred.
