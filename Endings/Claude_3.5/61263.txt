Ending 1:
The port was in chaos, but Retief remained calm. Gulver's face had turned several shades of purple, his attempts at diplomatic bluster falling flat against the methodical efficiency of the Armaments Control Commission.

"Let me explain," Retief said, pouring a glass of Bacchus wine for Arapoulous. "Sometimes bureaucracy needs a little... adjustment."

The two Armaments Control agents were carefully cataloging the seized weapons. Needlers, hand blasters, power pistols—an arsenal disguised as student baggage, intended for what was clearly a planned invasion of Lovenbroy.

Gulver sputtered. "This is an outrage! Diplomatic immunity—"

"Diplomatic immunity doesn't cover unauthorized weapons shipments," Retief said smoothly. "Especially not when they're part of an elaborate plan to seize control of a peaceful farming world."

Miss Furkle would have been horrified at the breach of interdepartmental protocol. But Retief had long since stopped caring about the niceties of bureaucratic procedure.

Arapoulous leaned in. "So what happens now?"

"Now," Retief said, "we make sure Lovenbroy keeps its vineyards. And its way of life."

The plan had been intricate. Boge would use the "students" as an invasion force. The tractors—actually armored siege units—would strip-mine Lovenbroy's land. Croanie, holding the mortgage, would foreclose. A simple territorial grab, dressed up in the language of bureaucratic procedure.

Gulver knew he was beaten. The weapons were documented. The shipping manifests would be examined. His carefully constructed plan was unraveling.

"The harvest will be saved," Retief said, raising his glass of black Bacchus wine. "Sometimes that's what matters most."

Ending 2:
The port's departure lounge became an impromptu diplomatic arena. Retief watched as Gulver's carefully constructed scheme collapsed around him, the Armaments Control agents methodically documenting every detail of the intercepted weapons shipment.

"You don't understand the complexity of interstellar relations," Gulver tried.

Retief smiled. "I understand perfectly. You were planning to take Lovenbroy's land. Use the 'students' as an invasion force. The tractors were actually siege units. Croanie would foreclose on the mortgage. A neat little plan."

Arapoulous stood nearby, his farmer's hands clenched. "Those were our vineyards. Our home."

The dispatch clerk approached. "Retief, we've confirmed. The original plan was to divert the students to Lovenbroy, not d'Land. The baggage—those weapons—was always meant to be there."

Gulver's diplomatic facade crumbled. The Armaments Control agents were methodical, professional. Each weapon was logged, each shipping manifest examined. There would be an investigation. Diplomatic repercussions.

"The Bacchus wine crop," Retief said, almost to himself. "Twelve years of growth. Tradition. Culture. All nearly destroyed by a bureaucratic land grab."

Miss Furkle would have been apoplectic at such informal intervention. But Retief had long since stopped caring about departmental niceties.

"What happens now?" Arapoulous asked.

"Now," Retief said, "we ensure your harvest. Your way of life."

Ending 3:
The port became a tableau of bureaucratic dismantling. Retief watched as Gulver's elaborate scheme unraveled, piece by careful piece.

"Diplomatic immunity," Gulver tried one last time.

"Doesn't cover invasion plans," Retief said smoothly.

The Armaments Control agents were professionals. Each weapon was logged. Each shipping manifest scrutinized. The "students" were nothing more than an invasion force, the tractors actual siege units designed to strip Lovenbroy's land.

Arapoulous watched, his farmer's hands rough and strong. "Those are our vineyards. Our home."

The dispatch clerk confirmed the details. The original plan had been to divert the students to Lovenbroy, not d'Land. The weapons were always meant to be part of the invasion.

"Twelve years," Retief said. "A wine crop that represents more than just agriculture. It's culture. Tradition."

Gulver knew he was beaten. The documentation was precise. The weapons clear evidence of an planned invasion.

"Sometimes," Retief said, pouring a glass of black Bacchus wine, "bureaucracy needs a human touch."

Ending 4:
The port's departure area transformed into an unexpected diplomatic battleground. Retief watched methodically as Gulver's carefully constructed plan disintegrated.

"Diplomatic channels—" Gulver began.

"Don't cover invasions," Retief interrupted.

The Armaments Control agents worked with professional precision. Weapons logged. Shipping manifests examined. The "students" revealed as an invasion force, the tractors actual siege units designed to strip Lovenbroy's fertile land.

Arapoulous stood watching, representing generations of farmers who had cultivated not just crops, but a way of life.

"Twelve years," Retief said. "A wine crop that represents more than agriculture. It's culture. Tradition."

The dispatch clerk confirmed the intricate details. The original plan had been a complete territorial seizure, masked by bureaucratic language and false student exchanges.

Gulver's diplomatic immunity meant nothing in the face of such clear evidence.

"What saves a world?" Retief mused. "Sometimes, attention to detail."

Ending 5:
The port became a theater of bureaucratic dismantling. Retief watched as Gulver's elaborate scheme collapsed, layer by carefully constructed layer.

"Diplomatic protocol—" Gulver attempted.

"Doesn't excuse invasion," Retief said.

Armaments Control agents worked with methodical precision. Weapons cataloged. Shipping manifests scrutinized. The "students" exposed as an invasion force, the tractors revealed as siege units designed to strip Lovenbroy's rich lands.

Arapoulous represented more than just a farmer. He represented a culture, a way of life that had survived generations.

"Twelve years," Retief said. "A wine crop that's more than agriculture. It's heritage."

The dispatch clerk confirmed the intricate details. The plan had been a complete territorial seizure, masked by bureaucratic obfuscation and false student exchanges.

Gulver knew he was defeated. The documentation was irrefutable.

"Sometimes," Retief said, pouring a glass of Bacchus wine, "bureaucracy needs a human touch."
